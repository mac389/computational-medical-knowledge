Definitions
Ischemic heart disease may be manifested clinically as either chronic 
stable  angina  (see  Chapter  54)  or  an  acute  coronary  syndrome 
(ACS). The latter, in turn, can be subdivided into ST-segment eleva-
tion myocardial infarction (STEMI), nonST-segment elevation myo-
cardial  infarction  (NSTEMI),  or  unstable  angina  (UA)  (Fig.  53-1). 
Chapters 51 and 52 discuss STEMI in detail. Because NSTEMI and 
UA are indistinguishable at initial evaluation and the entity of UA is 
receding  as  the  sensitivity  of  biomarkers  of  myocardial  injury 
increases,  they  are  often  described  together  as  NSTE-ACS  and  are 
discussed together in this chapter.

Features  that  help  differentiate  ACS  from  stable  angina  are  (1) 
onset  of  symptoms  at  rest  (or  with  minimal  exertion)  and  lasting 
longer than 10 minutes unless treated promptly; (2) severe, oppres-
sive pressure or chest discomfort; and (3) an accelerating pattern of 
symptoms that develop more frequently, occur with greater severity, 
or awaken the patient from sleep. Symptoms alone do not suffice to 
distinguish the three types of ACS from one another. Patients without 
persistent (>20 minutes) ST-segment elevation in two or more contigu-
ous  leads  but  with  biomarker  evidence  of  myocardial  necrosis  are 
classified  as  having  NSTEMI,  whereas  in  patients  without  such  evi-
dence of myocardial necrosis, UA is diagnoseda condition gener-
ally carrying a better prognosis.

Epidemiology
Globally, ischemic heart disease remains the number one cause of 
mortality;  it  was  responsible  for  7  million  of  the  53  million  deaths 
reported  in  2010.1  ACS,  the  acute  manifestation  of  ischemic  heart 
disease,  accounted  for  approximately  1.1  million  discharges  in  the 
United  States  in  2009,2  with  approximately  twice  this  number  in 
Europe. The annual number of hospital discharges for ACS in devel-
oped  countries  has  declined  slowly  over  the  past  two  decades, 
accompanied by an increase in nations with developing economies 
(see  Chapter  1).3  In  the  United  States,  three  recent  trends  have 
changed the frequency distribution of the types of ACS: (1) wider use 
of primary preventive therapies (aspirin, statins, smoking cessation) 
appears to have resulted in fewer cases of STEMI4; (2) aging of the 
U.S.  population,  with  higher  rates  of  diabetes  and  chronic  kidney 
disease (CKD), have increased the incidence of NSTE-ACS5; and (3) 
the use of more sensitive assays for myocardial necrosis (i.e., cardiac-
specific  troponin  [cTn])  has  shifted  the  classification  of  NSTE-ACS 

away  from  UA  toward  NSTEMI5  (Fig.  53-2;  also  see  Fig.  51-2A). 
Overall,  the  age-  and  sex-adjusted  incidence  rates  of  NSTEMI  have 
grown slowly since 1999.4

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The pathogenesis of NSTE-ACS involves four processes: (1) rupture 
of unstable atheromatous plaque, (2) coronary arterial vasoconstric-
tion, (3) imbalance between the supply and demand of the myocar-
dium  for  oxygen,  and  (4)  gradual  intraluminal  narrowing  of  an 
epicardial coronary artery because of progressive atherosclerosis or 
poststent restenosis. These processes are not mutually exclusive and 
can occur simultaneously in any combination.

Plaque rupture or erosion leads to the formation of superimposed 
thrombus  (typically  nonocclusive  in  NSTE-ACS)  along  with  subse-
quent  impaired  myocardial  perfusion,  which  if  persistent,  leads  
to  myocardial  necrosis.  Inflammation  of  the  arterial  wall  and  the 
action  of  metalloproteinases  produced  by  inflammatory  cells  in 
degrading  the  fibrous  wall  of  plaque  contribute  to  their  instability 
(see Chapter 41).

Vasoconstriction causing dynamic obstruction of coronary arterial 
flow  may  result  from  spasm  of  the  epicardial  coronary  arteries 
(Prinzmetal  angina,  see  below)constriction  of  small,  intramural, 
muscular coronary arteries resulting in increased coronary vascular 
resistance.  This  constriction  may  result  from  vasoconstrictors 
released by platelets, endothelial dysfunction (cardiac syndrome X; 
see  Chapter  77),  or  adrenergic  stimuli  (e.g.,  the  fight-or-flight 
response, cold, cocaine, or amphetamines [Chapter 68]). More than 
one of these mechanisms may be present simultaneously. Insufficient 
myocardial O2 supply may also occur in patients with severe anemia 
and hypotension. When an increase in myocardial O2 demand (e.g., 
tachycardia, fever, thyrotoxicosis) occurs in a patient with fixed nar-
rowing  of  an  epicardial  coronary  artery,  secondary  NSTE-ACS  may 
develop.

Activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets plays a central 
role (described in detail in Chapter 82) in the formation of thrombus 
following  plaque  rupture/erosion.  The  first  step  in  thrombus  forma-
tion is vascular injury or endothelial dysfunction, which causes adhe­
sion of platelets to the arterial wall via binding of platelet glycoprotein 
(GP) Ib to subendothelial von Willebrand factor. Exposure of platelets 
to subendothelial collagen and/or circulating thrombin causes plate-
let  activation  (Fig.  53-3),  which  induces  platelets  to  change  shape 
and results in degranulation with release of adenosine diphosphate

5-HT (hydroxytryptamine), ADP (via P2Y1 and P2Y12), and ATP and by adhesive ligands such as collagen and von Willebrand factor. Consequently, dense granule secretion 
of  platelet  agonists  and  secretion  of  TxA2  lead  to  amplification  of  platelet  activation,  which  causes  a  conformational  change  in  the  GP  IIb/IIIa  receptor  that  leads  it  to

In  parallel,  tissue  factor  expressed  within  the  lipid-rich  core  of 
atherosclerotic plaque, when exposed to circulating blood, activates 
the coagulation cascade. A complex of tissue factor and coagulation 

factors VIIa and Va leads to the formation of activated factor X (factor 
Xa),  which  in  turn  amplifies  the  production  of  activated  factor  IIa 
(thrombin).  The  cascade  proceeds  with  thrombin-induced  conver-
sion  of  fibrinogen  to  fibrin.  The  platelet  and  coagulation  systems 
converge in that thrombin is also a potent platelet activator. Platelet

GP  IIb/IIIa  binds  circulating  fibrinogen,  thereby  causing  platelet 
aggregation and ultimately producing a platelet-fibrin thrombus, por-
tions  of  which  may  embolize  distally  and  cause  myocardial 
necrosis.

The central role of coronary artery thrombosis in the pathogenesis 
of NSTE-ACS is supported by (1) autopsy findings of thrombi in the 
coronary arteries typically localized to a ruptured or eroded athero-
sclerotic plaque; (2) a high incidence of thrombotic lesions in coro-
nary atherectomy specimens in patients with NSTE-ACS in comparison 
to  those  with  stable  angina;  (3)  observations  of  plaque  ulceration 
and/or irregularities in the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaque con-
sistent with plaque rupture and thrombus formation as visualized by 
coronary  angiography,  intravascular  ultrasound  (IVUS),  optimal 
coherence tomography (OCT), or computed tomographic angiogra-
phy (CTA); (4) elevation of serum markers of platelet activity, throm-
bin generation, and fibrin formation; and (5) improvement in clinical 
outcome with antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment.

CLINICALASSESSMENT

HistoryandPhysicalExamination
NSTE-ACS  resulting  from  atherosclerosis  is  relatively  uncommon  in 
men younger than 40 years and women younger than 50 years, but 
the  incidence  rises  steadily  thereafter.  Although  NSTE-ACS  may  be 
the  initial  manifestation  of  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD),  most 
patients have preceding stable angina or myocardial infarction (MI). 
Patients  with  ACS  more  frequently  have  traditional  risk  factors  for 
CHD  (see  Chapter  42)  than  do  normal  subjects  or  those  with 
nonischemic chest pain. Although coronary risk factors can be used 
to assess risk in populations, they are less helpful in the assessment 
of individual patients.

The initial symptom is typically described as pressure, heaviness, 
or frank pain beneath the sternum (see Chapter 50), and it resem-
bles stable exertional anginabut is usually more intense and lasts 
longer (>20 minutes). Associated radiation to the ulnar aspect of the 
proximal  part  of  the  left  arm,  either  shoulder,  the  neck,  or  the  jaw 
may occur, but symptoms may be present anywhere between the ear 
and epigastrum.6 Symptoms such as diaphoresis, nausea, abdominal 
pain, dyspnea, and syncope may accompany the pain. Features that 
support the diagnosis include exacerbation of symptoms by physical 
exertion;  precipitation  by  severe  anemia,  infection,  inflammation, 
fever,  or  metabolic  or  endocrinologic  (e.g.,  thyroid)  disorders;  and 
importantly, relief with rest or nitroglycerin. Atypical manifestations, 
such as dyspnea without chest discomfort, pain limited to the epigas-
trium, or indigestion, represent anginal equivalents. These atypical 
findings are more prevalent in women, older adults, and patients with 
diabetes, CKD, or dementia and can lead to underrecognition, under-
treatment,  and  worse  outcomes.  Chest  pain  that  is  pleuritic  or 
described as stabbing is generally noncardiac in origin.

The clinical manifestations may be sudden, with severe, new-onset 
symptoms occurring during minimal exertion (Canadian Cardiovas-
cular Society class7 [CCSC] III) or at rest (CCSC IV), an accelerating 
pattern  of  angina  (more  frequent,  more  intense,  longer  lasting),  or 
angina occurring shortly after a completed MI.8

Physical Examination
Findings on physical examination may be normal, although patients 
with large territories of myocardial ischemia may have audible third 
and/or fourth heart sounds. Rarely, hypotension, pale cool skin, sinus 
tachycardia, or frank cardiogenic shock can occur; these findings are 
far more common with STEMI than with NSTE-ACS. The examination 
can also be important in that potential precipitating causes of ACS 
can be identified, such as fever, resistant hypertension, tachycardia, 
profound bradycardia, thyroid disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Finally,  findings  on  physical  examination  such  as  pulse  deficits, 
tachypnea, and tachycardia in the presence of clear lung fields and 
pulsus paradoxus with jugular venous distention may lead to alterna-
tive life-threatening diagnoses such as aortic dissection, pulmonary 
embolism, or cardiac tamponade.

1157

Electrocardiography
The most common abnormalities on the 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG)  are  ST-segment  depression  and  T  wave  inversion;  they  are 
more likely to be present while the patient is symptomatic. Compari-
son  with  a  recent  ECG  is  important  because  dynamic  ST-segment 
depressions as little as 0.05 mV are a sensitive (albeit not very spe-
cific) marker for NSTE-ACS. Greater degrees of ST-segment depression 
predict  poorer  outcomes,  however,  even  when  adjusted  for  other 
prognostic factors.9,10 Transient ST-segment elevation lasting less than 
20 minutes occurs in up to 10% of patients and suggests either coro-
nary  vasospasm  or  an  aborted  infarction.  Deep  (>0.2 mV)  T  wave 
inversions  are  compatible  with,  but  not  necessarily  diagnostic  of 
NSTE-ACS,  whereas  isolated  T  wave  inversions  of  lesser  magnitude 
are not particularly helpful given their low specificity. In patients with 
definite NSTE-ACS, findings on the ECG may be normal or nondiag-
nostic in more than half of patients. Because ischemia may occur in 
a territory that is not well represented on the standard 12-lead ECG 
(see below) or because the patient may have episodic ischemia that 
is missed on the initial ECG, tracings should be repeated every 20 to 
30 minutes until the symptoms resolve, the diagnosis of MI is estab-
lished or excluded, or an alternative diagnosis is made.

Coronary angiography identifies a culprit lesion in the circumflex 
coronary  artery  in  a  third  of  patients  with  high-risk  NSTE-ACS.11 
Because  the  standard  12-lead  ECG  does  not  represent  this  territory 
well, assessment of posterior leads V7 through V9 should be consid-
ered in patients with a history suggestive of ACS and a nondiagnostic 
initial ECG. Similarly, ACS caused by isolated involvement of an acute 
marginal branch of the right coronary artery is often not apparent on 
the standard 12-lead ECG but may be suspected from leads V3R and 
V4R.12  Therefore  it  is  useful  to  obtain  these  extra  leads  in  patients 
suspected of having ACS but with normal findings on a 12-lead ECG.
Continuous monitoring of the ECG in the days following NSTE-ACS 
can identify patients at higher risk for recurrent events. ST-segment 
depressions  noted  on  such  monitoring  within  the  first  week  after 
NSTE-ACS are associated with an increased risk for reinfarction and 
death.13

Laboratory
Biomarkers reflecting the pathogenesis of NSTE-ACS aid in diagnosis 
and prognosis. They include markers of myocyte necrosis, hemody-
namic  perturbation,  vascular  damage,  accelerated  atherosclerosis, 
and  inflammation  (Fig.  53-4).  During  the  past  decade,  cardiac-
specific  troponins  (cTnI  and  cTnT)  have  become  the  biomarkers  of 
choice to identify myocardial necrosis and hence distinguish NSTEMI 
from UA. Several pathobiologic mechanisms can lead to the release 
of detectable levels of cTn in blood (Table 53-1). Because of differ-
ences among assays, there is consensus that the diagnosis of acute 
MI requires an elevation in cTnI or cTnT above the 99th percentile of 
the normal range for the specific assay used,14 a typical temporal rise 
and  decline  when  serial  samples  are  tested,  and  a  clinical  picture 
consistent with ACS.

Although elevated cTn usually reflects myocardial necrosis, it does 
not always reflect MI. Abnormal elevations have been observed with 
a  number  of  conditions,  including  heart  failure,  pulmonary  embo-
lism,  myocarditis,  pericarditis,  transplant  rejection,  chemotherapy, 
and  direct  or  indirect  cardiac  trauma.  Furthermore,  cTnI  may  be 
elevated chronically at a low-grade level in patients with severe CKD 
(stages IV and V), and all cTn is cleared more slowly in patients with 
impaired renal function. Therefore interpretation of the clinical sig-
nificance of elevated cTn in such patients requires care. In fact, an 
estimated 60% to 70% of individuals with chest discomfort seen in an 
emergency  department  will  have  measurable  cTn  concentrations,15 
but only a minority of them are experiencing acute MI.

Patients with clinical findings suggestive of NSTE-ACS should have 
serial  measurements  of  cTn  beginning  at  initial  evaluation.  Newer 
high-sensitivity  assays  available  in  Europe  (but  not  in  the  United 
States  as  of  2012)  can  exclude  myocardial  necrosis  if  two  values 
measured 3 hours apart are both normal.16 However, the specificity 
of high-sensitivity cTn assays in the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS may be as

low  as  60%,  even  in  patients  with  established  CHD.17  The  fourth-
generation  cTn  assays  currently  used  in  the  United  States  are  less 
sensitive than the so-called high-sensitivity assays, and two negative 
cTn assays at least 6 to 9 hours apart are needed to exclude MI. The 
change in cTn between measurements appears to be more important 
than the actual concentration and can help distinguish MI from other 
processes  that  cause  elevated  cTn.18  In  addition,  normal  early  cTn 
levels are useful in the identification of patients at very low risk for 
cardiovascular  events  over  the  next  6  months19;  they  are  useful  in 
long-term prognostication as well (Fig. 53-5).

FIGURE 53-5  Survival  of  patients  with  MI  according  to  baseline  troponin. 
A, Mortality. B, MI and congestive heart failure. Individuals with a possible MI and 
low  levels  of  cTnI  (0.02  to  0.04 ng/mL),  which  are  below  the  99th  percentile  for 
this assay, had more subsequent events than did those with undetectable values. 
(From Kavsak PA, Newman AM, Lustig V, et al: Long-term health outcomes associ-
ated with detectable troponin I concentrations. Clin Chem 53:220, 2007.)

As already noted, an important consequence of the use of increas-
ingly  sensitive  cTn  assays  is  that  the  fraction  of  NSTE-ACS  patients 
with  UA  has  decreased  in  favor  of  NSTE-MI.  This  reclassification  is 
important because even minor elevations in cTn are associated with 
poorer outcomes than in patients without evidence of myonecrosis. 
Reclassification  from  UA  to  NSTEMI  can  lead  to  more  aggressive 
treatment of patients with a low-level, positive cTn assay.20

Other  biomarkers  also  increase  in  the  days  to  weeks  following 
NSTE-ACS. Natriuretic peptides (i.e., brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] 
and N-terminal pro-BNP) rise in proportion to the degree of ventricu-
lar  distention  and  correlate  with  the  risk  for  adverse  events.21,22  In 
patients  with  NSTE-ACS,  a  baseline  BNP  measured  on  average  40 
hours  after  the  onset  of  symptoms  correlated  strongly  with  risk  for 
death, heart failure, and MI through 10 months in a graded fashion.21 
Baseline  natriuretic  peptide  levels  also  help  identify  patients  more 
likely to benefit from more aggressive treatments, including intensive 
anti-ischemic regimens,22 aggressive statin therapy,23 and early coro-
nary revascularization.24

C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  is  a  marker  of  inflammation  that  is  ele-
vated following ACS, and persistently elevated levels after discharge 
are associated with increased long-term cardiovascular risk. Elevated 
levels of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin indicate 
the presence of diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome and portend 
accelerated atherosclerosis and an increased risk for cardiovascular 
events  in  both  the  short  and  long  term.25  Renal  dysfunction,  as 
reflected by elevated levels of cystatin C and creatinine, is associated 
with an increase in cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular 
mortality, in patients with NSTE-ACS.

Several  novel  biomarkers  can  help  improve  prognostication  in 
patients with NSTE-ACS (Table 53-2). These biomarkers tend to fall

into  two  general  categories:  (1)  markers  that  predict  death  and/or 
ischemic events26-33 and (2) markers that predict heart failure.34-36

Multimarker  approaches  involving  biomarkers  that  are  indepen-
dent predictors of outcome are increasingly being used.37 One such 
approach uses three common biomarkers (cTn, CRP, and BNP), with 
an increasing number of abnormal markers correlating with a step-
wise higher risk for subsequent ischemic complications.38

Measurement  of  serum  lipids,  including  low-density  lipoprotein 
(LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycer-
ide, is useful in identifying important, treatable risk factors for coro-
nary atherothrombosis (see Chapter 45). The first available sample 
should  be  used  to  guide  therapy.  Evaluation  for  other  secondary 
causes  of  NSTE-ACS39  may  also  be  appropriate  in  selected  patients 
(e.g., determining the presence of hypoxemia, anemia, and disturbed 
thyroid function) because such secondary NSTE-ACS can often be 
treated and recurrences prevented.

NoninvasiveTesting
Goals  of  noninvasive  testing  in  patients  with  suspected  NSTE-ACS 
include (1) determining the presence or absence of coronary artery 
disease (CAD); (2) establishing CAD as the cause of the elevated cTn 
in patients with other possible explanations; (3) evaluating the extent 
of  residual  ischemia  after  medical  therapy  has  been  initiated,  thus 
guiding further therapy; (4) localizing the ischemia before a planned 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with multives-
sel disease; and (5) assessment of left ventricular function.

The safety of early stress testing in patients with NSTE-ACS has been 
debated, but pharmacologic or symptom-limited stress testing appears 
to  be  safe  after  a  period  of  at  least  24  hours  of  stabilization  without 
symptoms of active ischemia40; contraindications include active isch-
emia or other signs of hemodynamic or electrical instability.

The merits of various modalities of stress testing have been com-
pared  (see  Chapter  13).  Exercise  stress  myocardial  perfusion 
imaging with sestamibi (Chapter 16) and stress echocardiography 
with  dobutamine  have  slightly  more  sensitivity  than  electrocardio-
graphic  exercise  stress  testing  does  alone.  A  useful  approach  is  to 
individualize the choice based on patient characteristics, local avail-
ability, and expertise in interpretation. For most patients, electrocar-
diographic exercise stress testing is recommended if the ECG at rest 
lacks ST-segment abnormalities. If ST abnormalities exist at rest or if 

the patient is unable to exercise or cannot achieve a significant work-
load during exercise, pharmacologic stress perfusion or echocardio-
graphic imaging is recommended. Findings consistent with high risk 
(e.g., severe ischemia as reflected by ST-segment depression 0.2 mV, 
hypotension, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, new or worsening left ven-
tricular dysfunction) are indications to proceed rapidly with coronary 
angiography  with  the  intent  of  performing  revascularization  if  the 
coronary anatomy is appropriate.

Echocardiography  is  useful  in  the  assessment  of  left  ventricular 
systolic and diastolic function and can also be used to identify left 
atrial  dilation,41  functional  mitral  regurgitation,42  tricuspid  annular 
plane  systolic  excursion,43  diastolic  dysfunction,44  ventricular 
mechanical dyssynchrony,45 and ultrasound lung comets43 (extravas-
cular  lung  fluid  observed  on  thoracic  ultrasound  scanning)each 
of which has been associated with an adverse prognosis in patients 
with NSTE-ACS.

Contrast-enhanced coronary CTA (CCTA) in patients with or sus-
pected of having NSTE-ACS can help establish the diagnosis of epi-
cardial  CAD  in  patients  with  equivocal  signs  and  symptoms  and 
identify unstable plaque at high risk for rupture. Detailed analysis of 
plaque  morphology  has  identified  two  characteristicspositive 
vessel  remodeling  and  low-attenuation  plaque  of  lipid-rich  lesions 
(Fig.  53-6)that  were  associated  with  plaque  rupture  and  ACS  in 
1059 patients observed for clinical events for an average of 27 months 
after imaging.46

CCTA can be used to exclude ACS rapidly in hospital emergency 
departments  in  patients  with  suspected  ACS.  Three  randomized 
trials47-49  (see  Chapter  18)  examined  the  value  of  early  CCTA  in 
assessment  of  patients  in  the  emergency  department.  Whether  a 
CCTA approach to patients suspected of having ACS will be superior 
to  judicious  outpatient  clinical  follow-up  of  low-risk  patients  with 
normal cTn levels remains to be determined.

Cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  using  a  rapid-scan  protocol 
can  provide  precise  measurements  of  ventricular  function  and 
volumes, evaluate ventricular wall edema, identify areas of infarction 
versus  hibernating  myocardium,  establish  the  presence  of  myocar-
dial  perfusion,  quantify  wall  motion  and  the  ejection  fraction,  and 
identify  myocardium  at  risk  in  patients  with  NSTE-ACS.50  These 
detailed assessments can then help guide PCI, particularly when the 
culprit  lesion  is  uncertainsuch  as  in  patients  with  multivessel 
disease or with borderline stenoses.

InvasiveImaging
Invasive coronary angiography has been the reference technique for 
imaging  the  coronary  arterial  tree  for  more  than  five  decades.  The 
culprit  lesion  in  NSTE-ACS  typically  exhibits  an  eccentric  stenosis 
with  scalloped  or  overhanging  edges  and  a  narrow  neck  (see 
Chapter 20). These angiographic findings may represent disrupted 
atherosclerotic plaque and/or thrombus. Features suggesting throm-
bus include globular intraluminal masses with a rounded or polypoid 
shape. Haziness of a lesion suggests the presence of thrombus, but 
this finding is not specific.

Approximately 85% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of NSTE-ACS 
have  significant  coronary  obstruction  (i.e.,  >50%  stenosis  of  the 
luminal  diameter)  in  at  least  one  major  coronary  artery.  Most  have 
obstructive disease involving multiple epicardial arteries (10% with 
left main coronary artery, 35% with three-vessel disease, 20% with 
two-vessel disease), whereas only approximately 20% have isolated 
single-vessel disease.51 The remaining 15% have no evidence of signifi-
cant coronary obstruction on angiography; this finding occurs more 
frequently in women and nonwhite individuals. In such patients, NSTE-
ACS, if present, may be related to microvascular coronary obstruction, 
endothelial  dysfunction,  or  coronary  artery  spasm  and  is  generally 
associated with a more favorable prognosis. The absence of coronary 
obstruction  on  angiography,  however,  should  prompt  a  search  for 
causes of the symptoms other than coronary atherosclerosis.

Two  invasive  cross-sectional  imaging  techniquesIVUS  and 
OCTcan  provide  additional  detail  regarding  plaque  morphology 
and  are  sometimes  used  clinically  to  visualize  the  deployment  of 
intracoronary  stents.  A  large  necrotic  core  visualized  by  IVUS  in 
culprit  lesions  undergoing  intracoronary  stenting  can  predict  the 
no-reflow  phenomenon  after  stenting.52  OCT  of  plaque  in  patients 
with ACS has demonstrated its lipid content, calcification, and throm-
bus.53 Plaque with a thin fibrous cap is associated with a high risk for 
rupture if the hemoglobin A1c content is 8.0% or higher.53

Even though several other invasive techniquesincluding angios-
copy, intravascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), near-infrared 
spectroscopy, palpography, thermoscopy, and shear stress imaging
have  been  developed,  large-scale  prospective  evaluation  of  these 
diagnostic techniques is needed to assess and compare their clinical 
usefulness and cost-effectiveness.

RiskAssessment
Residual Risk
The risk for recurrent ischemic events following an episode of ACS 
depends as much on the presence and stability of multifocal lesions 
as  on  the  culprit  lesion  responsible  for  the  initial  event.54  Thus 
because aggressive interventional approaches are increasingly being 
successful  in  the  treatment  of  culprit  lesions,  aggressive  medical 
management of the remaining plaque is required to prevent recurrent 
events.54 The percentage of patients with more than one active plaque 
on angiography has been correlated with the level of high-sensitivity 
CRP  (hsCRP).55  These  findings  provide  an  important  pathophysio-
logic link between inflammation, more diffuse active CAD, and recur-
rent cardiac events in the months to years following a clinical ACS 
event.

Natural History
Patients with UA, defined as NSTEMI-ACS without abnormal elevation 
of  cTn,  have  lower  short-term  mortality  (<2.0%  at  30  days)  than  do 
those with NSTEMI or STEMI.56 The early mortality risk with NSTEMI 
is related to the extent of myocardial damage and resulting hemody-
namic  compromise  and  is  lower  than  in  patients  with  STEMI,  who 
usually have larger infarcts.4,56 In contrast, long-term outcomes with 
respect to both mortality and nonfatal events are worse in patients 
with  NSTE-ACS  than  in  those  with  STEMI.57  This  finding  probably 
results  from  the  greater  age,  extent  of  CAD,  previous  MI,  comorbid 
conditions (such as diabetes and impaired renal function), and likeli-
hood of recurrence of ACS in patients with NSTE-ACS than in those 
with STEMI.

Combined Risk Assessment Scores
Several  risk  scores  that  integrate  clinical  variables  and  findings  on 
the  ECG  and/or  from  serum  cardiac  markers  have  been  developed 
for  patients  with  NSTE-ACS.58-60  The  TIMI  (Thrombolysis  In  Myocar-
dial Ischemia) risk score (Fig. 53-7) identifies seven independent risk 
factors; their sum correlates directly with death or recurrent ischemic 
events.58  This  simple,  rapid  assessment  of  risk  at  initial  evaluation 
identifies  high-risk  patients  who  can  derive  benefit  from  an  early 
invasive strategy and more intensive antithrombotic therapy. This risk 
score  also  predicts  the  severity  of  angiographic  findings,  including

even simpler score, the TIMI risk index (age in decades × heart rate/
systolic blood pressure), predicts mortality in patients with NSTEMI.63
The GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk score60 
has also identified risk factors that are independently associated with 
increased  mortality.  Although  perhaps  more  accurate,  it  is  more 
complex than the TIMI risk score and is not easily calculated by hand.

MANAGEMENT

Treatment  of  NSTE-ACS  consists  of  two  phases:  acute  management 
directed  at  the  clinical  symptoms  and  stabilization  of  the  culprit 
lesion  or  lesions  and  longer-term  therapy  aimed  at  preventing  pro-
gression of the underlying disease and future plaque rupture/erosion. 
In a prospective natural history study of patients with NSTE-ACS who 
successfully underwent PCI of the culprit lesion, 20% had a second 
ACS event over a mean of 3.4 years, with half of these events being 
ascribed  to  the  original  culprit  lesion  and  the  other  half  to  a  new 
lesion.54

General
Patients with new or worsening chest discomfort or an anginal equiv-
alent symptom suggestive of ACS should be transported rapidly to the 
emergency  department  of  a  hospital  by  an  ambulance,  if  possible, 
and  evaluated  immediately  (Fig.  53-8).64  The  initial  evaluation 
should include a directed history and physical examination and an 
ECG performed within 10 minutes of arrival.65 Blood specimens for 
cTn assay should be obtained with expedited assessment via either 
a point-of-care device or laboratory measurement that can provide 
results  within  60  minutes.  Additional  laboratory  studies,  such  as  a 
complete  blood  count,  serum  electrolytes,  creatinine,  and  glucose, 
can help guide early management treatments and strategy.

Patients  with  elevated  cTn  or  new  ST-segment  abnormalities  or 
deemed to be at moderate or high risk based on a validated risk score 
should be admitted to a specialized cardiovascular or intensive care 
unit. Patients with UA but without elevated cTn and ischemic electro-
cardiographic changes should generally be admitted to a monitored 
bed, preferably in a cardiovascular step-down unit.6 In these settings,

continuous  electrocardiographic  monitoring  with  telemetry  detects 
tachyarrhythmias, alterations in atrioventricular and intraventricular 
conduction, and changes in ST-segment deviation. Patients should be 
placed at bed rest, arterial O2 saturation should be assessed continu-
ously by oximetry, and supplemental O2 is advisable in patients with 
reduced  arterial  O2  saturation  (<90%)  and/or  in  those  with  heart 
failure and pulmonary rales. Ambulation, as tolerated, is permitted if 
the  patient  has  been  stable  without  recurrent  chest  discomfort  or 
changes on the ECG for at least 12 to 24 hours. Patients with atypical 
symptoms and low risk or those who have symptoms more consistent 
with another noncardiac cause may be observed in the emergency 
department or a short-stay unit. A second cTn assay should be per-
formed  3  to  6  hours  after  the  first,  and/or  further  assessment  with 
noninvasive  imaging  or  stress  testing  may  be  considered  to  permit 
rapid exclusion of ACS.

Anti-IschemicTherapy
A primary goal in the management of NSTE-ACS is relief of ischemic 
symptoms and prevention of the severe short- and long-term sequelae, 
including recurrent MI, heart failure, and death.

Nitrates
Nitrates are endothelium-independent vasodilators that both increase 
myocardial blood flow by coronary vasodilation and reduce myocar-
dial oxygen demand by lowering cardiac preload through venodila-
tion and  reduce  cardiac afterload  by  inducing arterial dilation  and 
thereby diminishing ventricular wall stress.

Sublingual (or buccal) nitroglycerin (0.3 to 0.6 mg up to three times 
at  5-minute  intervals)  should  be  administered  to  patients  without 
hypotension,  beginning  even  before  hospital  arrival  whenever  pos-
sible. If ischemic symptoms persist and/or the patient is hypertensive 
or in heart failure, intravenous nitroglycerin (5 to 10 µg/min, with the 
dose increased gradually to 200 µg/min as needed) should be initi-
ated  as  long  as  systolic  blood  pressure  remains  higher  than 
100 mm Hg.  Topical  or  long-acting  oral  nitrates  can  be  used  if  the 
patient has been free of pain for 12 to 24 hours. Tolerance to the anti-
ischemic  effects  of  nitrates  may  develop  within  12  to  24  hours  and 
can be ameliorated by nitrate-free intervals. If symptoms do not allow 
nitrate-free  intervals,  increasing  the  dose  may  be  effective.  Discon-
tinuation  of  high  doses  of  nitrates,  particularly  when  administered 
intravenously, should be performed in a gradual manner to prevent 
recurrent ischemia.

Contraindications  to  nitrate  use  are  hypotension  or  the  use  of  
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, 
vardenafil)  within  the  previous  24  to  48  hours.  PDE-5  inhibitors 
reduce the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
and thereby cause an exaggeration and prolongation of the vasodila-
tor  effects  of  nitrates,  which  can  result  in  severe  hypotension,  
myocardial  ischemia,  or  even  death.  Nitrates  should  be  used  with 
caution  in  patients  with  severe  aortic  valve  stenosis,  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest, right 
ventricular  infarction,  or  hemodynamically  significant  pulmonary 
embolism.

Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents
Much of the evidence supporting the use of beta-adrenergic receptor 
blockers (beta blockers) for NSTE-ACS has been extrapolated from 
clinical trials, predominantly in patients with STEMI, in which it was 
demonstrated  that  beta  blockers  reduce  reinfarction,  ventricular 
fibrillation, and death (see Chapter 52). A systematic review pooling 
data on patients with UA from trials performed more than 25 years 
ago (in the pre-cTn era) suggested that beta blockers reduce the risk 
for progression to MI.66 Whether beta blockers have similar efficacy 
in the modern era of intensive pharmacologic management and early 
revascularization is not clear.

Oral beta-blocking agents in doses used for chronic stable angina 
(see  Chapter  54)  should  be  initiated  within  the  first  24  hours,6,66 
with  the  following  exceptions:  (1)  signs  of  decompensated  heart 
failure;  (2)  evidence  of  a  lowcardiac  output  state;  (3)  increased

Calcium Channel Blockers
These  agents  have  vasodilator  effects 
and  reduce  arterial  pressure.  Some, 
such as verapamil and diltiazem, also 
slow the heart rate, reduce myocardial 
contractility,  and  thereby  reduce  O2 
requirements.  Early  studies  suggested 
that  diltiazem  may  reduce  the  inci-
recurrent  MI.68  Calcium 
dence  of 
channel blockers have been effective in 
reducing  ischemia  in  patients  with 
NSTE-ACS  and  persistent 
ischemia 
despite treatment with full-dose nitrates 
and beta blockers, as well as in patients 
with contraindications to beta blockers

risk for cardiogenic shock; or (4) atrioventricular block, asthma, or 
reactive  airway  disease.  Beta  blockers  can  be  administered  to 
patients with heart failure once their condition has stabilized. If isch-
emia and/or chest pain persists despite intravenous nitrate therapy, 
intravenous beta blockers may be used cautiously, followed by oral 
administration.  Intravenous  beta  blockers  should  be  avoided  in 
patients  with  acute  MI  and  heart  failure  at  initial  evaluation.67  The 
choice of beta blockers can be individualized by taking into account 
the  drugs  pharmacokinetics,  physician  familiarity,  and  cost,  but 
beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, such as pindo-
lol, should generally be avoided.

Morphine
In patients with persistent pain despite therapy with nitrates and beta 
blockers  (see  below),  intravenous  boluses  of  morphine  sulfate  at 
doses of 2 to 5 mg may be administered every 10 minutes for up to 
three  times  while  carefully  monitoring  blood  pressure,  respiration, 
and  mental  status.6  Morphine  may  act  as  both  an  analgesic  and 
an anxiolytic, and its venodilator effects may be beneficial by reduc-
ing  ventricular  preload.  The  latter  action  is  especially  useful  in 
patients  with  pulmonary  congestion.  However,  morphine  may  also 
cause hypotension, and if it occurs, supine positioning and intrave-
nous  saline  should  be  used  to  restore  blood  pressure;  pressors  
are  rarely  needed.  If  respiratory  depression  develops,  naloxone  

Ranolazine
This novel antianginal agent exerts its 
effects without altering the heart rate 
or  blood  pressure.  Its  predominant 
mechanism  of  action  is  inhibition  of 
the late sodium current in myocardial 
cells,  thereby  reducing  some  of  the 
deleterious  effects  attributed  to  the 
overload  of  intracellular  sodium  and  calcium  during  ischemia  
(see  Chapter  21).  Ranolazine  reduces  ischemic  episodes  and  the 
need for nitroglycerin in patients with chronic stable angina, both as 
monotherapy and in combination with calcium channel blockers or 
beta  blockers.  Ranolazine  underwent  evaluation  in  a  placebo-
controlled trial of 6560 patients with NSTE-ACS who were monitored 
for  an  average  of  almost  1  year.72  In  the  overall  trial  population, 
ranolazine did not reduce the primary composite outcome of cardio-
vascular  death,  MI,  or  recurrent  ischemia  but  did  decrease  the  
incidence  of  recurrent  ischemia.  The  primary  outcome,  however,  
was reduced significantly in the subgroups of patients with elevated

AntiplateletTherapy
Given  the  central  role  of  platelet  activation  and  aggregation  in  the 
pathogenesis of ACS, it comes as no surprise that antiplatelet therapy 
represents a key component of treatment in patients with NSTE-ACS 
(Table 53-3; also see Fig. 53-3).

Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)
Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-
1), which blocks the synthesis and release of TxA2, a platelet activator,

TABLE53-3  Recommendations for Oral Antiplatelet Agents65

RECOMMENDATIONS

CLASS*

LEVEL

1163

Aspirin should be given to all patients without contraindications at an initial loading dose of 150-300 mg and at a maintenance 

dose of 75-100 mg daily long-term regardless of treatment strategy

A P2Y12 inhibitor should be added to aspirin as soon as possible and maintained over a period of 12 months unless there are 

contraindications such as excessive risk for bleeding

A proton pump inhibitor (preferably not omeprazole) in combination with DAPT is recommended in patients with a history of 

gastrointestinal hemorrhage or peptic ulcer and is appropriate for patients with multiple other risk factors (Helicobacter pylori 
infection, 65 years, concurrent use of anticoagulants or steroids)

Prolonged or permanent withdrawal of P2Y12 inhibitors within 12 months after the index event is discouraged unless clinically 

indicated

Ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily) is recommended for all patients at moderate to high risk for ischemic 
events (e.g., elevated troponins), regardless of initial treatment strategy and including those pretreated with clopidogrel 
(which should be discontinued when ticagrelor is commenced)

Prasugrel (60-mg loading dose, 10-mg daily dose) is recommended for P2Y12 inhibitornaïve patients (especially diabetic 

individuals) in whom the coronary anatomy is known and who are proceeding to PCI unless there is a high risk for  
life-threatening bleeding or other contraindications

Clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose, 75-mg daily dose) is recommended for patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel

A 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel (or a supplementary 300-mg dose at PCI following an initial 300-mg loading dose) is 

recommended for patients scheduled for an invasive strategy when ticagrelor or prasugrel is not an option

A higher maintenance dose of clopidogrel, 150 mg daily, should be considered for the first 7 days in patients managed with 

PCI and without increased risk for bleeding

Increasing the maintenance dose of clopidogrel based on platelet function testing is not advised as routine but may be 

considered in selected cases

Genotyping and/or platelet function testing may be considered in selected cases when clopidogrel is used

In patients pretreated with P2Y12 inhibitors who need to undergo nonemergency major surgery (including CABG), postponing 

surgery for at least for 5 days after cessation of ticagrelor or clopidogrel and for 7 days for prasugrel should be considered if 
clinically feasible and if the patient is not at high risk for ischemic events

Starting (or restarting) ticagrelor or clopidogrel after CABG should be considered as soon as considered safe

The combination of aspirin with an NSAID (selective COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective NSAID) is not recommended

Prasugrel is given a IIa recommendation as the overall indication, including clopidogrel-pretreated patients and/or unknown coronary anatomy. The class I recommendation 
here refers to the specifically defined subgroup.
CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; DAPT = dual antiplatelet therapy; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

Cardiology (ESC). Eur Heart J 32:2999, 2011.

thereby decreasing platelet aggregation and arterial thrombus forma-
tion.  Because  the  inhibition  of  COX-1  by  aspirin  is  irreversible,  the 
antiplatelet effects last for the lifetime of the plateletsapproximately 
7 to 10 days. Several placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the 
benefit of aspirin in patients with NSTE-ACS.74 In addition to reducing 
adverse clinical events early in the course of treatment, aspirin also 
reduces the frequency of ischemic events in secondary prevention. 
It  is  a  cornerstone  of  antiplatelet  therapy  in  patients  with  all  forms  
of ACS.75

Even though doses of ASA in randomized trials have ranged from 
50 to 1300 mg/day, there does not appear to be a dose-response effect 
on  efficacy,  but  gastrointestinal  bleeding  is  increased  at  higher 
doses.74  The  CURRENT  OASIS-7  (Clopidogrel  and  Aspirin  Optimal 
Dose  Usage  to  Reduce  Recurrent  EventsSeventh  Organization  to 
Assess  Strategies  in  Ischemic  Symptoms)76  trial  randomly  assigned 
25,086 patients with ACS to receive high-dose (300 to 325 mg/day) or 
low-dose (75 to 100 mg/day) ASA for 30 days (and to high-dose versus 
regular-dose  clopidogrel;  see  below).  No  difference  in  the  risk  for 
cardiovascular  death,  MI,  or  stroke  was  observed  between  the  two 
doses, but gastrointestinal bleeding increased with the higher dose. 
Guidelines recommend that in patients with NSTE-ACS in whom con-
tinual ASA therapy has not been prescribed, the initial loading dose 
should  be  162  to  325 mg,  followed  by  a  maintenance  dose  of  75  to 
100 mg  daily.6  Data  from  PLATO  (Study  of  Platelet  Inhibition  and 
Patient  Outcomes),  a  large  trial  of  ticagrelor  (see  Chapter  82),  an 

oral  antiplatelet  agent  that  inhibits  the  P2Y12  receptor,  provides 
another reason to favor low-dose ASA.77

So-called ASA resistance may occur during chronic therapy,78 with 
2%  to  8%  of  patients  exhibiting  a  limited  antiplatelet  effect  (i.e., 
minimal change in inhibition of platelet aggregation). These patients 
tend to have a greater risk for recurrent cardiac events.79 Causes of 
ASA resistance are varied and include poor compliance (pseudore-
sistance),  reduced  absorption,  interaction  with  ibuprofen,  overex-
pression  of  COX-2  mRNA,  and  use  of  enteric-coated  dosage  forms. 
Rarely,  a  genetic  or  other  intrinsic  reason  for  minimal  response  to 
ASA is present. There is no evidence, however, that routine monitor-
ing of antiplatelet effects with adjustment of the dose is a clinically 
effective strategy.

Contraindications to ASA include documented allergy (e.g., ASA-
induced asthma), nasal polyps, active bleeding, or a known platelet 
disorder.  Dyspepsia  or  other  gastrointestinal  symptoms  with  long-
term ASA therapy (i.e., ASA intolerance) does not usually preclude 
therapy  in  the  short  term.  In  patients  who  have  an  allergy  or  who 
cannot tolerate ASA, desensitization or substituting clopidogrel, pra-
sugrel, or ticagrelor is recommended.75

P2Y12 (Adenosine Diphosphate) Inhibitors
Management of ACS now routinely includes dual antiplatelet therapy 
(DAPT), which consists of ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor (see Fig. 53-3).

clopidogrel,  and  prasugrel)  and  a  cyclopentyl-triazolopyrimidine 
(ticagrelor). Thienopyridines act by irreversibly blocking binding of 
ADP  to  the  platelet  surface  P2Y12  receptor,  thereby  interfering  with 
both platelet activation and aggregation by ADP. They are prodrugs 
that require oxidation by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) system 
to form active metabolites.80 Thienopyridines also reduce fibrinogen, 
blood  viscosity,  and  erythrocyte  deformability  and  aggregability 
through mechanisms that appear to be independent of ADP. In con-
trast, ticagrelor acts directly as a reversible blocker of the P2Y12 recep-
tor. Drugs that inhibit the CYP system do not affect ticagrelor.

Clopidogrel
This drug largely avoids the hematologic complications (neutropenia 
and, rarely, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) associated with 
ticlopidine, the first widely used thienopyridine. When clopidogrel is 
absorbed,  approximately  85%  is  hydrolyzed  by  circulating  esterase 
and thus rendered inactive. The remaining clopidogrel must be oxi-
dized by the hepatic CYP system to generate the active metabolites 
that inhibit the P2Y12 receptor.

The addition of clopidogrel to ASA was studied in the CURE (Clopi-
dogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial of 12,562 
patients  with  NSTE-ACS  in  which  patients  were  treated  with  ASA, 
unfractionated  heparin  (UFH)  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin 
(LMWH), and other standard therapies and were randomly assigned 
to receive a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by 75 mg 
daily or placebo.81 The addition of clopidogrel to ASA reduced car-
diovascular  death,  MI,  or  stroke  by  20%  in  both  low-  and  high-risk 
patients  with  NSTE-ACS,  regardless  of  whether  they  were  managed 
with medical therapy, PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
(Fig. 53-9). Benefit was seen as early as 24 hours, with Kaplan-Meier 
curves beginning to diverge after just 2 hours.82 Moreover, the benefit 
continued  throughout  the  trials  1-year  treatment  period.  Benefit  of 
treatment  before  PCI  was  also  observed,  with  a  31%  reduction  in 
cardiac events at 30 days and 1 year in patients with NSTE-ACS ran-
domly assigned to DAPT versus ASA alone.83

These and similar findings in other trials led to a class IA recom-
mendation  in  the  American  College  of  Cardiology/American  Heart 

Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for clopidogrel treatment before 
PCI.84 In patients undergoing CABG, those who had received clopido-
grel within 5 days of surgery had an increased risk for major bleeding 
and the need for reoperation, which led to the recommendation that 
use of clopidogrel be discontinued at least 5 days before surgery, if 
possible.6

In NSTE-ACS, the initial loading dose of 300 to 600 mg clopidogrel 
is followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg daily. Use of a 600-mg 
loading dose achieves a steady-state level of platelet inhibition after 
just  2  hours,  more  rapidly  than  the  300 mg  dose.  In  the  CURRENT 
OASIS  7  trial,  high-dose  clopidogrel  (600-mg  loading  dose,  150-mg 
maintenance dose for 7 days, then 75 mg thereafter) did not reduce 
the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in patients with 
NSTE-ACS, although it increased major bleeding and the need for red 
cell transfusions.76 However, an analysis of the subgroup of patients 
in  CURRENT  OASIS-7  who  underwent  PCI85  and  a  meta-analysis 
of  more  than  25,000  patients  undergoing  PCI86  both  demonstrated 
that  a  600-mg  loading  dose  of  clopidogrel  reduces  cardiovascular 
events  following  PCI  when  compared  with  300 mg.  Thus  600 mg 
clopidogrel is the preferred loading dose for patients with NSTE-ACS 
undergoing PCI.75,84

Two  strategies  for  initiating  clopidogrel  therapy  in  patients  with 
NSTE-ACS have evolved: (1) starting clopidogrel at the time of arrival 
or hospital admission or (2) delaying treatment with clopidogrel until 
after coronary angiography and then administering the drug on the 
catheterization table if PCI is performed. The early treatment strategy 
is preferred because it affords the benefits of reducing early ischemic 
events, albeit at the cost of an increase in bleeding in the minority of 
patients who undergo CABG instead of or immediately after PCI.87

As  with  ASA,  hyporesponders  to  clopidogrel  have  been  identified88 
and  have  higher  rates  of  recurrent  cardiac  events,  including  stent 
thrombosis, MI, and death.89 The incidence of patients not achieving 
the expected pharmacologic response to clopidogrel varies from 5% 
to  30%,  depending  on  the  population  and  the  definition  used  to 
assess response.89 Hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel is more common 
in patients with diabetes, as well as in those with obesity, of advanced 
age, and with a genetic polymorphism of the CYP system.90 Patients 
with  a  minimal  antiplatelet  response 
to  clopidogrel  have  lower  concentra-
tions  of  the  active  metabolite,  thus 
indicating  failure  of  this  necessary 
conversion.

FIGURE53-9  Clopidogrel for NSTE-ACS. The benefit of clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke 
in patients with NSTE-ACS in the CURE trial and in patients managed medically or with PCI or CABG is shown. RR = rela-
tive risk; Rx = drug. (From Yusuf S, Zhao F, Mehta SR, et al: Effects of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin in patients with 
acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. N Engl J Med 345:494, 2001; and Fox KA, Mehta SR, Peters 
R, et al: Benefits and risks of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin in patients undergoing surgical revascularization 
for nonST-elevation acute coronary syndrome: The Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent ischemic Events 
[CURE] trial. Circulation 110:1202, 2004.)

Several polymorphisms of the gene 
encoding  for  the  CYP2C19  enzyme 
have  been  associated  with  reduced 
production of the active metabolite of 
clopidogrel  (see  also  Chapters  7, 
52,  and  82).69  These  polymorphisms 
(especially  the  reduced-function  *C2 
allele)  occur  in  approximately  a  third  
of white individuals and up to half of 
Asians and have been associated with 
increased adverse clinical outcomes in 
patients treated with clopidogrel.91 In 
other studies, reduced-function alleles 
have  been  associated  with  increased 
stent  thrombosis.92  Testing  for  these 
polymorphisms  in  patients  who  are 
candidates  for  thienopyridine  treat-
ment can identify those who are likely 
to be unresponsive or hyporesponsive 
to  the  standard  dose  of  clopidogrel 
and are candidates for alternative anti-
platelet  regimens  (Fig.  53-10).  Three 
randomized trials that evaluated more 
aggressive  antiplatelet  regimens  in 
patients  with  high  platelet  reactivity 
after  standard  doses  of  aspirin  and 
clopidogrel,  however,  did  not  show  
a  significant  reduction  in  clinical  car-
diovascular  events  with  higher  doses 
of  antiplatelet  drugs  versus  standard 
doses.93-95  Data  from  a  study  of

FIGURE53-10  CYP2C19 and clinical outcomes. The association between status 
as a carrier of a CYP2C19 reduced-function allele and the primary efficacy outcome 
or stent thrombosis is shown in subjects receiving clopidogrel in the TRITONTIMI 
38  trial.  Among  1459  subjects  who  were  treated  with  clopidogrel  and  could  be 
classified  as  CYP2C19  carriers  or  noncarriers,  the  rate  of  the  primary  efficacy 
outcome (a composite of death from cardiovascular [CV] causes, MI, or stroke) was 
significantly higher in carriers than in noncarriers. (From Mega JL, Close SL, Wiviott 
SD, et al: Cytochrome p-450 polymorphisms and response to clopidogrel. N Engl J 
Med 360:354, 2009.)

patients  with  UA  undergoing  PCI  showed  that  a  daily  maintenance 
dose of 225 mg or more of clopidogrel (at least three times the stan-
dard  dose)  is  necessary  in  heterozygote  carriers  of  the  CYP2C19*2 
allele to achieve the same level of platelet inhibition as that in noncar-
riers who receive 75 mg daily.96 Thus the reason that these three trials 
failed  to  show  clinical  benefit  with  more  intensive  antiplatelet  regi-
mens in patients with high platelet reactivity may be due in part to 
insufficiently high doses of antiplatelet therapy.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) modestly reduce the antiplatelet effect 
of  clopidogrel  when  assessed  by  platelet  function  assays97  because 
of competition for metabolism by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Observational 
studies  have  raised  concern  that  this  effect  may  lead  to  ischemic 
complications  in  patients  receiving  such  an  inhibitor,  especially 
omeprazole,  as  opposed  to  clopidogrel  without  a  PPI.  However,  a 
randomized, double-blind trial98 and an analysis of ticagrelor (which 
is not metabolized via the CYP system) versus clopidogrel99 indicated 
that a clinically significant interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs is 
unlikely.

Prasugrel
This thienopyridine is a prodrug like clopidogrel, and its active metab-
olite  is  an  irreversible  inhibitor  of  the  platelet  P2Y12  receptor  and 
thereby an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. However, unlike clopido-
grel, prasugrel is oxidized rapidly in one step to its active metabolite 
and  becomes  active  within  30  minutes  of  ingestion.  Although  the 
active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel exert equal antiplate-
let effects when studied in vitro, generation of the prasugrel metabolite 
is  approximately  10  times  as  great  as  generation  of  the  clopidogrel 
metabolite, which results in roughly 10 times greater potency.

TRITONTIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Out-
comes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with PrasugrelThrombolysis 
in  Myocardial  Infarction)100  randomly  assigned  13,608  patients  with 
ACS  (10,074  with  NSTE-ACS)  in  whom  PCI  was  planned  to  receive 
either prasugrel (60-mg loading dose, 10-mg daily maintenance dose) 
or what was then the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
dose of clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose, 75-mg daily maintenance 
dose)which had been shown in the CURE trial to be beneficial in 
NSTE-ACS  patients  who  underwent  PCI.  All  patients  also  received 
ASA.83 The primary efficacy endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, and 
stroke) was reduced significantly by 19% with prasugrel (Fig. 53-11A).

The  benefit  was  particularly  striking  (30%)  in  patients  with  diabe-
tes.101 In the 12,844 patients who received coronary stents at the time 
of PCI, prasugrel reduced the incidence of stent thromboses by half 
in comparison to clopidogrel. This relative reduction in stent throm-
bosis was similar in bare-metal and drug-eluting stents.102

These  findings  of  the  superiority  of  prasugrel  over  clopidogrel 
agrees with the aforementioned concept that the limited efficacy of 
clopidogrel versus prasugrel is related to the slower and less effective 
generation  of  the  active  metabolite  of  clopidogrel.103  Indeed,  in  a 
crossover study of patients undergoing PCI for stable angina, Wiviott 
and  coauthors  reported  that  a  60-mg  loading  dose  of  prasugrel 
resulted in greater platelet inhibition than did a 600-mg loading dose 
of  clopidogrel.104  The  same  was  observed  during  maintenance 
therapy, for which the comparison was made between 10 mg prasu-
grel and 150 mg clopidogrel daily.

Not unexpectedly, the greater platelet inhibitory effect of prasugrel 
was  associated  with  increased  bleeding.  In  TRITONTIMI  38,  there 
was a 0.6% absolute (32% relative) higher incidence of major (includ-
ing  fatal)  bleeding.  The  risk  for  bleeding  was  especially  high  in 
elderly adults (75 years of age), in whom the use of prasugrel should 
be limited to those at high risk and in those with reduced body weight 
(<60 kg,  132 lb).  Avoidance  of  treating  such  patients  with  prasugrel 
unless they are at high risk for thrombosis is advisable, and if prasu-
grel is used, they should be treated with a 5-mg instead of a 10-mg 
maintenance dose. Patients with a history of stroke or transient isch-
emic attack (TIA) have a prohibitive incidence of intracranial hemor-
rhage.  Therefore  prasugrel  is  indicated  in  patients  with  NSTE-ACS 
immediately before PCI but is contraindicated in those with a history 
of  stroke  or  TIA.100  In  patients  who  were  younger  than  75  years, 
weighed at least 60 kg, and had no previous history of stroke or TIA 
(i.e., the core group of patients for whom the FDA approved use of 
the drug), prasugrel was associated with a robust 26% reduction in 
the  primary  endpoint.  Use  of  prasugrel  should  be  discontinued  at 
least 7 days before surgery is performed, whenever possible.75 DAPT 
with  ASA  and  a  P2Y12  receptor  inhibitor  should  be  continued  for  1 
year following PCI.

Prasugrel  (10 mg  daily)  was  compared  with  clopidogrel  (75 mg 
daily)  in  7243  patients  younger  than  75  years  who  were  being 
managed  medically  following  NSTE-ACS  in  the  TRILOGY  ACS  (Tar-
geted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically 
Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial.105 No difference occurred 
in  the  primary  composite  endpoint  of  cardiovascular  death,  MI,  or 
stroke, nor in severe bleeding.

Ticagrelor
In contrast to the thienopyridines, whose active metabolites are irre-
versible  platelet  inhibitors,  ticagrelor  is  a  reversible  blocker  of  the 
P2Y12  platelet  receptor  that  acts  directly  on  the  platelet  and  has  a 
half-life of approximately 12 hours.106 Although it has an active metab-
olite,  the  potency  of  the  latter  is  similar  to  that  of  the  parent  drug; 
both  are  excreted  into  bile.  Like  prasugrel,  ticagrelor  can  inhibit 
P2Y12-mediated platelet aggregation almost completely.

A  phase  III  pivotal  trial  (PLATO)  compared  ticagrelor  (180-mg 
loading  dose,  followed  by  90 mg  twice  daily)  with  clopidogrel  (a 
300- or 600-mg loading dose, followed by a 75-mg daily maintenance 
dose);  both  groups  also  received  ASA.  The  PLATO  trial  enrolled 
18,624 patients, 11,067 (59%) of whom had NSTE-ACS.106 The primary 
endpoint,  a  composite  of  cardiovascular  death,  MI,  and  stroke,  fell 
significantly by 16% (Fig. 53-11B). A significant 16% reduction in MI, 
a  21%  reduction  in  cardiovascular  death,  and  a  22%  relative  (1.4% 
absolute) reduction in total mortality also occurred. The rate of stent 
thrombosis  was  reduced  significantly,  from  1.9%  to  1.3%.  A  broad 
array of subgroups showed greater clinical efficacy of ticagrelor than 
clopidogrel,  including  those  who  had  previously  received  clopido-
grel,  in  patients  treated  with  a  noninvasive  strategy,  as  well  as  in 
patients with STEMI.

PLATO showed no benefit of ticagrelor in the subgroup of patients 
enrolled in the United States, in whom the dose of aspirin was higher 
on average than in other countries.77 Whether this finding is related 
to chance, to more frequent use of ASA at 325 mg daily, or to some 

1166

other aspect of care in the United States remains uncertain. The FDA 
has  recommended  that  low-dose  (75  to  100 mg)  ASA  be  used  for 
maintenance  with  ticagrelor.  Regardless  of  which  P2Y12  inhibitor  is 
selected as the second antiplatelet agent, the dose of aspirin should 
be  decreased  to  75  to  100 mg  after  the  initial  loading  dose,  and 
patients should be monitored for bleeding while receiving DAPT for 
1  year  following  NSTE-ACS.75  PLATO  showed  a  0.7%  absolute  (19% 
relative) higher incidence of nonCABG-related major bleeding (P = 
0.03) with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel. Episodes of moderate or 
minor dyspnea and ventricular pauses exceeding 5 seconds occurred 
more  frequently  in  patients  treated  with  ticagrelor  than  in  those 
treated with clopidogrel.

The  PLATO  investigators  calculated  that  if  1000  hospitalized 
patients  with  ACS  were  treated  with  ticagrelor  and  ASA  and  com-
pared with a similar group treated with clopidogrel and ASA, there 
would be 14 fewer deaths, 11 fewer MIs, 6 to 8 fewer cases of stent 
thrombosis,  and  7  more  patients  with  nonCABG-related  major 
bleeding,  with  9  patients  switching  to  a  thienopyridine  because  of 
dyspnea. Because ticagrelor is a reversible agent, it can be started at 
the time of arrival at the emergency department and be continued

BALANCE OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY

for 1 year in medically managed patients or those undergoing PCI.75 
Although ticagrelor achieves a higher level of platelet inhibition than 
clopidogrel  does,  it  has  a  shorter  effective  half-life  and  should  be 
discontinued  5  days  before  CABG.75  However,  the  shorter  half-life 
mandates twice-daily administration of this drug and may therefore 
reduce compliance.

Protease-Activated Receptor-1 Antagonists
The oral protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antagonist vorapaxar, 
an investigational drug that inhibits thrombin-mediated platelet acti-
vation, has been studied in patients with ACS. It did not reduce the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint  significantly,  but  major  bleeding  was 
increased,  including  intracranial  hemorrhage.107  Thus  vorapaxar 
does not appear to have a role early after ACS. In the TRA-2PTIMI 50 
(Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Athero-
thrombotic Ischemic EventsThrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 
trial of 26,449 stable patients with a history of MI, ischemic stroke, or 
peripheral  vascular  disease,  the  addition  of  vorapaxar  to  standard 
therapies reduced ischemic events while increasing bleeding in com-
parison to placebo.108 Patients 2 weeks to 1 year after MI who were 
enrolled in TRA-2P had a 20% reduction in cardiovascu-
lar death, MI, or stroke. The drug may thus play a role in 
secondary prevention in patients with NSTEMI.

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors
These drugs block the final common pathway of platelet 
aggregation, fibrinogen-mediated cross-linkage of plate-
lets, caused by a variety of stimuli (e.g., thrombin, ADP, 
collagen, serotonin) (see Fig. 53-3). Three agents in this 
class are available: abciximab, a monoclonal antibody 
approved only in patients undergoing PCI; eptifibatide; 
and  tirofiban  (the  latter  two  are  reversible  small-
molecule  inhibitors).  Each  of  these  agents  is  adminis-
tered  as  an  intravenous  bolus  followed  by  continuous 
infusion.  The  activity  of  the  small-molecule  receptor 
blockers  and  the  accompanying  bleeding  risk  subside 
promptly after discontinuation of the infusion. Tirofiban 
and  eptifibatide  have  short  half-lives  (2  hours),  with 
restoration  of  platelet  function  in  about  4  hours;  thus 
they should be discontinued 2 to 4 hours before major 
surgery.  Abciximab  has  prolonged  action  (12  hours) 
and cannot be reversed rapidly, so major surgery should 
be deferred until at least 24 hours after administration.
Several trials have shown benefit of GP IIb/IIIa inhibi-
tion in the management of patients with NSTE-ACS, with 
an overall significant 9% relative reduction in death or 
MI at 30 days in a large meta-analysis.109 Tirofiban plus 
heparin  and  aspirin  significantly  reduced  the  rate  of 
death, MI, or refractory ischemia at 7 days when com-
pared with heparin plus ASA.110 In a trial involving 10,948 
patients, eptifibatide also significantly reduced the rate 
of  death  or  MI  at  30  days.111  However,  no  benefit  and 
higher early mortality were found with the use of abcix-
imab in patients with NSTE-ACS in whom an early con-
servative strategy was planned.112

The  benefit  of  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibition  appears  to  be 
greater when used in high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS, 
such as those with ST-segment changes and/or elevated 
troponin  concentration  or  diabetes.109,113  These  sub-
groups  have  more  thrombus  at  coronary  angiography 
and  thus  have  higher  risk  for  microvascular  emboliza-
tion. The benefit of GP IIb/IIIa inhibition has been con-
firmed even in patients with a background of clopidogrel 
pretreatment.113,114

In  a  meta-analysis  of  placebo-controlled  trials,  rates 
of  major  hemorrhage  were  significantly  higher  in 
patients treated with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitorsoccurring in 
2.4% as opposed to 1.4% of those given placebo.109 The 
rate  of  severe  thrombocytopenia  (<50,000/mm3)  was 
approximately 0.5% in patients treated with a GP IIb/IIIa 

inhibitor and heparin versus 0.3% in those receiving heparin alone. 
Thrombocytopenia is associated with increased bleeding and recur-
rent thrombotic events, thus indicating a need to monitor the platelet 
count daily during the GP IIb/IIIa infusion.

Two large trials have examined the timing of initiation of GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors:  routine  early  administration  at  initial  evaluation  versus 
delayed provisional use just before PCI.115,116 No difference was seen in 
the primary efficacy outcome between these two strategies, although 
routine early administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated 
with an increased risk for bleeding. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials 
involving  46,374  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  treated  with  a  GP  IIb/IIIa 
inhibitor at initial encounter and before angiography demonstrated a 
significant  11%  reduction  in  death  or  MI  at  30  days  versus  control 
patients (either no GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor or deferred use just before PCI), 
although the benefit of early routine use appeared to be modest when 
compared with a strategy of deferred use before PCI.117 Furthermore, 
there  was  no  reduction  in  mortality  and  a  23%  relative  increase  in 
major bleeding with routine early use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

Based on the totality of the evidence, a strategy of routine admin-
istration  of  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitors  to  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  who 
receive DAPT with ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor (i.e., triple antiplatelet 
therapy) is not recommended. However, selective use in patients at 
high risk for ischemic complications (such as patients with diabetes 
or angiographic evidence of thrombus) and at low risk for bleeding 
who are to undergo PCI appears to be more prudent. GP IIb/IIIa inhibi-
tors are also useful in the management of thrombotic complications 
during PCI.

AnticoagulantTherapy
In addition to antiplatelet therapy, as described above, an anticoagu-
lant  should  be  administered  to  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  as  soon  as 
possible. Several anticoagulants are available (see Chapter 82).

Heparin
UFH  is  a  mixture  of  polysaccharide  chains  of  different  length  that 
prevents coagulation by blocking thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. 
It  also  binds  to  circulating  plasma  proteins,  acute-phase  reactants, 
and  endothelial  cells  and  thus  has  an  unpredictable  anticoagulant 
effect. Because of its short half-life, UFH must be administered as an 
intravenous  infusion  to  ensure  a  stable  level  of  anticoagulation  in 
patients with ACS.

Despite  these  limitations,  treatment  with  intravenous  UFH  has 
been  an  important  component  of  therapy  for  patients  with  NSTE-
ACS.118 A meta-analysis showed a 33% reduction in death or MI with 
UFH plus aspirin versus aspirin alone.119 Variability in the anticoagu-
lant effects of UFH, which is quite common, is thought to result from 
the heterogeneity of UFH and from neutralization of heparin by cir-
culating plasma factors and by proteins released by activated plate-
lets.120  Daily  monitoring  of  the  anticoagulant  response  via  the 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is recommended, with 
titrations  being  made  according  to  a  standardized  nomogram  to 
achieve  an  APTT  of  50  to  70  seconds  or  1.5  to  2.5  times  control.65 
Based on the data available, the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a 
weight-adjusted dose of UFH (60-unit/kg bolus and 12-unit/kg/hr infu-
sion), as well as frequent monitoring of the APTT (every 6 hours until 
the target range is reached and every 12 to 24 hours thereafter) and 
adjustment of the dose if necessary.75 Adverse effects include bleed-
ing,  especially  when  the  APTT  is  elevated.  Immunogenic  heparin-
induced  thrombocytopenia  (HIT)  is  an  infrequent  but  serious 
complication that can cause thrombosis and bleeding and may even 
be fatal.

Heparin Reversal
Protamine  sulfate  binds  heparin  to  form  a  stable  salt,  thus  quickly 
reversing  the  anticoagulant  effect  of  UFH.  Approximately  1 mg  of 
protamine  is  required  to  neutralize  100  units  of  UFH.  Because  the 
half-life of UFH is approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, the dose of protamine 
necessary to reverse an infusion of UFH should be based on the total 
UFH  dose  administered  in  the  previous  2  to  3  hours.  After 

1167

administration  of  protamine,  the  APTT  can  be  used  to  assess  the 
efficacy of reversal of the anticoagulant effect of UFH. A slow intra-
venous injection is recommended to avoid hypotension or bradycar-
dia. Other common, but transient adverse reactions include flushing, 
feeling of warmth, and dyspnea. Protamine reverses approximately 
60% of the anticoagulant effect of LMWH (see below) but does not 
completely neutralize its anti-Xa activity.

Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin
These  forms  of  heparin  are  enriched  with  shorter  polysaccharide 
chains, which results in a more predictable anticoagulant effect than 
that of UFH. LMWH has several potential advantages over UFH: (1) 
its greater antifactor Xa activity (relative to factor IIa) inhibits throm-
bin generation more effectively; (2) LMWH induces greater release 
of tissue factor pathway inhibitor than UFH does, and it is not neutral-
ized by platelet factor 4; (3) LMWH less frequently causes HIT121; (4) 
the high and consistent bioavailability of LMWH allows subcutaneous 
administration;  (5)  monitoring  of  the  anticoagulation  level  is  not 
necessary; and (6) LMWH binds less avidly to plasma proteins than 
UFH does and therefore has a more consistent anticoagulant effect.
Because renal dysfunction affects LMWH more than UFH, the dose 
of LMWH should be reduced in patients with a creatinine clearance 
lower than 30 mL/min. The standard dose of enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg 
subcutaneously  every  12  hours,  with  dosing  only  once  daily  for 
patients with a creatinine clearance lower than 30 mL/min. Adminis-
tration  of  enoxaparin  for  up  to  8  days  (or  until  hospital  discharge) 
was  found  to  be  effective  in  patients  with  ACS,  whereas  extending 
therapy to 6 weeks did not further reduce ischemic events in patients 
with NSTE-ACS.122 UFH should not be administered in the catheteriza-
tion laboratory within 10 hours of treatment with enoxaparin, 1 mg/
kg, unless factor Xa activity is known to be low because concomitant 
administration  of  UFH  can  result  in  supratherapeutic  anti-Xa  and 
anti-IIa levels and cause excess bleeding.123 In the event of bleeding, 
the anticoagulant effect of LMWH can be reversed with protamine, 
but less effectively than reversal of UFH (see above).

In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with ASA, LMWH reduced the 
odds of death or MI by 66% when compared with placebo.119 Although 
several LMWHs have been approved, the weight of evidence supports 
the choice of enoxaparin.6,65 In a meta-analysis of 21,945 patients from 
six trials of patients with NSTE-ACS in which enoxaparin was com-
pared  with  UFH,  however,  new  or  recurrent  MI  occurred  less  fre-
quently  with  enoxaparin,  whereas  the  rate  of  major  bleeding  was 
similar between the drugs.124

Direct Thrombin Inhibitors
These drugs have a potential advantage over indirect thrombin inhibi-
tors such as UFH or LMWH in that they do not require antithrombin 
and  can  inhibit  clot-bound  thrombin.  They  do  not  interact  with 
plasma proteins, they provide a very stable level of anticoagulation, 
and  they  do  not  cause  thrombocytopeniathus  making  them  an 
excellent choice for anticoagulation in patients with a history of HIT.
Bivalirudin,  the  most  widely  used  direct  thrombin  inhibitor  in 
patients  with  ACS  or  undergoing  PCI,  binds  reversibly  to  thrombin 
and has a half-life of approximately 25 minutes. In the ACUITY (Acute 
Catheterization  and  Urgent  Intervention  Triage  Strategy)  trial,125 
patients with NSTE-ACS managed with an early invasive strategy were 
randomly  assigned  in  an  open-label  fashion  to  one  of  three  treat-
ments: (1) UFH or enoxaparin with or without a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, 
(2) bivalirudin with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, and (3) bivalirudin alone. 
The  key  findings  were  that  bivalirudin  alone  reduced  bleeding  in 
comparison  to  either  strategy  that  included  a  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitor, 
there were no differences in major bleeding between anticoagulants 
(UFH or enoxaparin versus bivalirudin) in patients taking a GP IIb/
IIIa  inhibitor,  and  there  were  no  differences  in  ischemic  events 
between  the  three  treatment  arms.125  Thus  the  use  of  bivalirudin 
monotherapy (with ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor but without a GP IIb/
IIIa inhibitor) is now considered an acceptable alternative in patients 
with NSTE-ACS managed with an early invasive strategy and may be 
preferred in patients with increased risk for bleeding who are under-
going PCI.6,65,75

In patients with NSTE-ACS before angiography, the recommended 
dose of bivalirudin is a 0.1-mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by an 
infusion at 0.25 mg/kg/hr. If started during the procedure, a 0.75-mg/
kg bolus dose of bivalirudin should be administered, followed by an 
infusion at 1.75 mg/kg/hr during PCI. It may be discontinued shortly 
after PCI to permit removal of arterial access sheaths. In patients with 
renal dysfunction, the infusion should be modified as follows: (1) if 
the creatinine clearance is lower than 30 mL/min and the patient is 
not  being  managed  with  hemodialysis,  the  infusion  rate  should  be 
reduced to 1 mg/kg/hr, and (2) in patients undergoing hemodialysis, 
the infusion rate should be reduced to 0.25 mg/kg/hr.

Factor Xa Inhibitors
Fondaparinux
This synthetic pentasaccharide is an indirect Xa inhibitor and requires 
the  presence  of  antithrombin  for  its  action.  The  OASIS-5  trial  com-
pared daily subcutaneous fondaparinux (2.5 mg) with standard-dose 
enoxaparin  in  20,078  patients  with  high-risk  NSTE-ACS.126  No  differ-
ence was found in the primary ischemic composite through 9 days, 
although fondaparinux did reduce major bleeding by nearly half and 
mortality at 30 days tended to be lower with fondaparinux. In patients 
undergoing  PCI,  however,  fondaparinux  was  associated  with  more 
than a threefold increased risk for catheter-related thrombi. Supple-
mental UFH at the time of catheterization (85 units/kg if no GP IIb/
IIIa  inhibitor  was  used;  60  units/kg  with  a  concomitant  GP  IIb/IIIa 
inhibitor)  appeared  to  minimize  the  risk  for  this  problem  with 
fondaparinux.127 Thus fondaparinux is an alternative for patients with 
NSTE-ACS managed noninvasively and, in particular, for patients at 
higher risk for bleeding.6,65

Otamixaban
At  infusions  of  0.105  and  0.140 mg/kg/hr,  the  investigational  direct 
factor  Xa  inhibitor  otamixaban  is  associated  with  fewer  ischemic 
complications and similar safety as UFH plus eptifibatide in patients 
with ACS.128 A large phase III trial of otamixaban is under way.129

Oral Anticoagulation
Several trials have examined oral anticoagulation with warfarin fol-
lowing ACS because of the rationale that prolonged treatment might 
extend  the  benefit  of  early  anticoagulation  with  a  parenteral  anti-
thrombin agent. Although the combination of ASA plus warfarin was 
more effective than aspirin alone for long-term secondary prevention 
of MI, this combination is associated with increased serious bleed-
ing.130 In patients without a coronary stent but with another indication 
for warfarin, such as chronic atrial fibrillation or severe left ventricu-
lar dysfunction, who are at high risk for systemic embolization, the 
combination of ASA and warfarin may be useful for long-term anti-
thrombotic management.

Triple  therapy  (i.e.,  the  combination  of  aspirin,  a  P2Y12  inhibitor, 
and warfarin) is sometimes required in patients with NSTE-ACS after 
stenting who have atrial fibrillation or another strong indication for 
warfarin. It may be associated with a high bleeding risk, especially 
with long-term administration,131 but it has not been tested prospec-
tively to date against DAPT in a large randomized trial. When such 
triple  therapy  is  deemed  essential,  the  combination  of  low-dose 
aspirin (75 to 81 mg daily), warfarin (titrated meticulously to an inter-
national normalized ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 2.5), and the use of clopido-
grel  for  as  short  a  time  as  necessary  is  recommended.6  Use  of 
bare-metal  stents  rather  than  drug-eluting  stents  may  be  preferable 
because they can reduce the duration of P2Y12 therapy required. The 
2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the man-
agement  of  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation  in  whom  NSTE-ACS  has 
been  treated  with  a  stent  recommend  shortened  courses  of  triple 
therapy  (aspirin,  clopidogrel,  a  vitamin  K  antagonist  [VKA]),  fol-
lowed by long-term single antiplatelet therapy and a VKA.132

Two potent oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixa-
ban) have been studied in phase III trials of patients with ACS. In the 
ATLAS  ACS  2TIMI  51  (Anti-Xa  Therapy  to  Lower  Cardiovascular 
Events  in  Addition  to  Standard  Therapy  in  Subjects  with  Acute  
Coronary  SyndromeThrombolysis  in  Myocardial  Infarction)  trial,

lative incidence of cardiovascular death is shown in patients after ACS who received 
aspirin  and  a  thienopyridine  and  were  randomly  assigned  to  placebo  (n  =  5114) 
versus rivaroxaban, 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 5113). (Modified from Mega JL, Braun-
wald  E,  Wiviott  SD,  et al:  Rivaroxaban  in  patients  with  a  recent  acute  coronary 
syndrome. N Engl J Med 366:9, 2012.)

low-dose rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily) and very low-dose rivaroxa-
ban (2.5 mg twice daily)which are 50% and 25%, respectively, of 
the  approved  dose  of  this  drug  in  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation
were compared with placebo as an add-on to standard DAPT therapy 
(ASA  and  clopidogrel  in  92%  of  patients)  in  15,527  patients  with 
recent ACS.133 Rivaroxaban (doses combined) reduced the primary 
composite of death, MI, or stroke significantly by 16% when compared 
with  antiplatelet  therapy  without  an  anticoagulant.  In  addition,  
rivaroxaban substantially reduced overall mortality and stent throm-
bosis, although excessive bleeding, including higher rates of intrace-
rebral  hemorrhage,  were  observed.  The  2.5-mg  twice-daily  dose  
of  rivaroxaban  had  a  more  favorable  profile  in  that  it  reduced  
cardiovascular mortality (Fig. 53-12) by 34% and total mortality by 
32% and resulted in less bleeding than the 5 mg twice-daily dose of 
rivaroxaban.

In  the  APPRAISE-2  (Apixaban  for  Prevention  of  Acute  Ischemic 
Events 2) trial,134 apixaban, 5 mg twice daily (a full dose of Xa inhibi-
tor  with  properties  similar  to  those  of  rivaroxaban),  was  compared 
was placebo in 7392 patients with recent ACS (60% had NSTE-ACS) 
who were being treated with aspirin and clopidogrel. The trial was 
stopped  prematurely  because  of  excess  major  bleeding  with  no 
apparent reduction in recurrent ischemic events in patients randomly 
assigned to apixaban. The difference in outcome between APPRAISE-2 
and ATLAS-2TIMI 51 might be related to the higher dose of the Xa 
inhibitor in APPRAISE-2; in contrast to ATLAS-2TIMI 51, it included 
patients with a history of stroke.

BleedingRiskAssessment,Prevention,
andTreatment
Severe bleeding is the most common nonischemic complication of 
antithrombotic  therapy  and  is  associated  with  poorer  outcomes  in 
patients with ACS,135 but controversy has surrounded the independent 
contribution  of  bleeding  to  mortality.136,137  Whether  the  increase  in 
mortality  and  other  adverse  events  observed  in  patients  who  have 
had serious bleeding is a result of the bleeding per se or the higher 
risk  for  adverse  outcomes  from  the  ACS  in  patients  who  are  more 
likely to experience bleeding is unclear. Both mechanisms probably 
contribute.

Regardless, strong effort must be made to minimize bleeding. Euro-
pean  guidelines65  recommend  assessment  of  bleeding  risk  (as  well 
as risk for ischemia) in all patients with NSTE-ACS via an established 
risk score (Table 53-4).138 Practical steps to reduce the risk for bleed-
ing in patients with NSTE-ACS include the use of (1) weight-adjusted 
(instead  of  fixed)  doses  of  anticoagulants;  (2)  modified  dosing  of 
antithrombotics  in  patients  with  renal  dysfunction;  (3)  selection  of

anticoagulants with a lower-risk bleeding profile (e.g., fondaparinux 
in  patients  managed  conservatively,  bivalirudin  with  an  early  inva-
sive strategy) in patients at higher bleeding risk; (4) low-dose aspirin 
(75 to 100 mg daily) after the initial loading dose76; (5) gastrointesti-
nal protective agents in patients at high risk for gastrointestinal bleed-
ing98; (6) minimization of concomitant therapies (such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs)  that  increase  the  risk  for  gastrointestinal 
bleeding; (7) radial arterial access, smaller sheath sizes, and timely 
removal of sheaths for coronary angiography and PCI139; and (8) use 
of bare-metal (instead of drug-eluting) stents, which permits a shorter 
course of DAPT (1 month instead of 6 to 12 months).

Among the key recommendations included in the Working Group 
on Thrombosis of the ESC140 are (1) interruption and/or neutralization 
of antithrombotic therapy in the case of major bleeding, unless ade-
quate  hemostasis  is  achieved  by  other  specific  measures;  (2)  with-
holding  of  transfusions  in  stable  patients  with  a  hemoglobin  level 
higher than 8 g/dL if bleeding has stopped; and (3) continuation of 
antithrombotic  therapy  without  interruption  in  the  case  of  minor 
bleeding.

InvasiveVersusConservativeManagement
Two  general  approaches  to  the  use  of  cardiac  catheterization  and 
revascularization  can  be  taken  in  patients  with  NSTE-ACS:  (1)  an 
early  invasive  strategy  involving  routine  early  (within  48  hours  of 
initial evaluation) cardiac catheterization, followed by PCI, CABG, or 

continuing  medical  therapy,  depending  on  the  coronary  anatomy, 
and (2) a more conservative approach, with initial medical manage-
ment and catheterization being reserved for patients with recurrent 
ischemia  either  at  rest  or  on  a  noninvasive  stress  test,  followed  by 
revascularization if the anatomy is suitable.

A meta-analysis of seven recent trials confirmed an overall signifi-
cant 25% reduction in mortality and a 17% reduction in nonfatal MI 
after 2 years of follow-up in patients managed with an early invasive 
strategy.141  These  findings  favoring  an  early  invasive  strategy  were 
also  observed  in  key  subgroups  who  traditionally  are  less  likely  to 
undergo early angiography, including older adults,142,143 patients with 
CKD,144 and women,145 although one analysis in women did not show 
benefit.146 The apparently conflicting results in women may be recon-
ciled by considering the risk of the women who were included in the 
studies inasmuch as a sex-specific collaborative meta-analysis147 dem-
onstrated benefit of an invasive strategy in all men and in high-risk 
women but not in low-risk women.

Thus  an  early  invasive  strategy  is  recommended  in  patients  with 
NSTE-ACS who have ST-segment changes and/or positive troponin on 
admission or in whom these high-risk features develop over the sub-
sequent 24 hours. Other high-risk indicators, such as recurrent isch-
emia or evidence of congestive heart failure, are indications for an 
early invasive strategy.6,65,75 An early invasive strategy is also advised 
in  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  previously  treated  with  CABG6  and  in 
patients who have had NSTE-ACS within 6 months of a previous PCI 
and in whom restenosis may be the cause.65 Indications for an initial

conservative strategy include patients with life-threatening comorbid 
conditions or in whom the risks outweigh the benefits, patients who 
do not wish to undergo an invasive procedure, and low-risk patients 
without recurrent symptoms.65,75

Timing of an Invasive Approach
A meta-analysis of four trials involving 4013 patients with NSTE-ACS 
compared  an  early  invasive  strategy  (average  time  to  angiography 
ranging from 1.2 to 14 hours) with a delayed invasive strategy (average 
time to angiography of 21 to 86 hours). Mortality and MI rates in the 
two  strategies  did  not  differ,148  but  the  early  invasive  approach  was 
associated  with  significant  reductions  in  recurrent  ischemia  (41%) 
and  duration  of  hospital  stay  (28%)  and  with  favorable  trends  with 
respect to bleeding and the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, 
or  stroke.  This  analysis  lends  support  to  an  early  invasive  strategy, 
especially  in  high-risk  patients  such  as  those  with  continuing  isch-
emia  despite  intensive  medical  therapy,  as  well  as  in  patients  with 
acute heart failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (See Chapter 55)
Angiographic  success  (TIMI  epicardial  grade  2  or  3  flow)  can  be 
achieved in the vast majority (95%) of patients with NSTE-ACS who 
undergo PCI, even in those considered to be at high risk.149 However, 
the development of intraprocedural complications, such as transient 
or sustained loss of a side branch, abrupt closure, distal embolization, 
or development of the no-reflow phenomenon, has been associated 
with a fourfold to fivefold increase in the risk for ischemic complica-
tions and death over the next 30 days.149,150 Use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
improves  acute  outcomes  following  PCI.  Although  use  of  a  drug-
eluting stent reduces the risk for restenosis, there is a risk for late stent 
thrombosis following implantation of a drug-eluting stent, especially 
when  DAPT  (i.e.,  ASA  and  a  P2Y12  inhibitor)  is  discontinued.  This 
serious complication can be reduced in the long term (at least 6 to 
12 months) in patients treated with drug-eluting stents.

The  third-generation  stents  coated  with  everolimus  have  demon-
strated consistent benefits in comparison to earlier-generation stents 
coated  with  sirolimus  or  paclitaxel151,152  and  in  comparison  to  bare-
metal stents.153 Given reductions in stent thrombosis and other isch-
emic events following placement of an everolimus-eluting stent, the 
need for prolonged (12 months) DAPT is less clear, and shorter dura-
tions of DAPT may be possible.154

Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Versus  
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
Several trials have compared PCI and CABG in patients with ischemic 
heart disease, many of whom had NSTE-ACS. Based on the results, 
CABG is recommended for patients with disease of the left main coro-
nary artery, as well as for those with multivessel disease (involving 
all  three  major  epicardial  vessels  or  the  proximal  left  anterior 
descending artery plus a second artery) and a left ventricular ejection 
fraction lower than 40% and/or diabetes mellitus. In a recent study of 
1900 patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD (27% of whom had 
NSTE-ACS),  CABG  significantly  reduced  the  composite  endpoint  of 
death, MI, or stroke in comparison to PCI.155 However, as experience 
with multivessel and left main PCI grows, an increasing number of 
nondiabetic patients with this more complex coronary anatomy may 
also be suitable for PCI. For other patients with less severe CAD, PCI 
is  ordinarily  performed  if  the  coronary  anatomy  is  suitable.  PCI  is 
associated  with  slightly  lower  initial  morbidity  and  mortality  and 
lower rates of stroke155 than CABG is, but a higher need for repeated 
PCI155-157 and somewhat less relief of angina.158

Lipid-LoweringTherapy
Long-term  treatment  with  lipid-lowering  therapy,  especially  with 
statins, has shown benefit in patients following acute MI and NSTE-
ACS (see also Chapters 42 and 45).159 In a prespecified subgroup 
of more than 3200 patients with UA in the LIPID (Long-Term Interven-
tion with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) trial, pravastatin therapy 
led  to  a  significant  26%  reduction  in  total  mortality.160  Initiation  of

DAYS FOLLOWING RANDOMIZATION

FIGURE 53-13  Effect  of  intensive  statin  therapy  following  NSTE-ACS.  The 
benefit of intensive statin therapy initiated early after ACS in the PROVE ITTIMI 22 
trial  is  shown.  A  significant  reduction  in  events  occurred  in  the  first  30  days.  
(From  Ray  KK,  Cannon  CP,  Cairns  R,  et al:  The  timing  of  benefits  of  intensive

2005.)

statins in the hospital at the time of an ACS has been associated with 
long-term benefits in outcome when compared with placebo.161

In  the  PROVE  ITTIMI  22  (Pravastatin  or  Atorvastatin  Evaluation 
and  Infection  TherapyThrombolysis  in  Myocardial  Infarction  22) 
trial, conducted in 4162 patients who were enrolled an average of 7 
days following an ACS, intensive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvas-
tatin, 80 mg, versus moderate lipid-lowering therapy with pravastatin, 
40 mg (Fig. 53-13), resulted in a 16% reduction (median LDL levels 
achieved in the two arms were 62 and 95 mg/dL, respectively) in the 
primary endpoint (a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, 
revascularization, or unstable angina leading to hospitalization) and 
a 25% reduction in death, MI, or urgent revascularization.162 Benefits 
began to emerge only 2 weeks after random assignment,163 thus high-
lighting the importance of early initiation of intensive statin therapy 
after  ACS.  Based  in  part  on  these  results,  the  National  Cholesterol 
Education  Program  (NCEP)  recommended  an  optional  therapeutic 
LDL goal of less than 70 mg/dL in high-risk patients with CHD, such 
as those with a history of an ACS.164 Regression of CAD after ACS was 
observed  with  intensive  lipid-lowering  therapy  in  diabetic  patients 
with NSTE-ACS when LDL lower than 70 mg/dL was achieved.165

Four additional trials of intensive versus moderate (standard) statin 
therapy followed PROVE ITTIMI 22, one involving post-ACS patients 
and three involving patients with stable CAD. A meta-analysis of the 
five published trials, including 39,612 patients monitored for a median 
of  5.1  years,  showed  highly  significant  reductions  of  15%  in  major 
vascular  events  and  a  13%  reduction  in  coronary  death  or  MI  with 
intensive versus standard statin therapy.166 Of note, no adverse effects 
of ultra-low LDL (below 40 to 50 mg/dL) have emerged,167 and thus 
statin doses should not be routinely titrated downward in asymptom-
atic patients who are tolerating high-dose statins after ACS.

Intensive statin therapy for patients with an ACS should start, at the 
latest, at the time of hospital discharge,6 but benefit of intensive statin 
therapy before PCI with a 44% reduction in both peri-PCI MI and other 
adverse events through 30 days was demonstrated in a meta-analysis 
of  13  randomized  trials168thus  suggesting  a  benefit  if  high-dose 
statin therapy is started at the time of admission. Although epidemio-
logic studies have shown that patients with higher HDL cholesterol 
levels  have  a  lower  incidence  of  CHD,  no  pharmacologic  therapies 
directed  at  raising  HDL  have  yet  demonstrated  an  improvement  in 
clinical outcomes in patients with or after ACS in the statin era (see 
also Chapters 42 and 45).

DischargeandPosthospitalCare
The  time  of  hospital  discharge  following  ACS  affords  a  teachable 
moment for the patient,169 when the physician and staff can review 
and optimize the medical regimen for long-term treatment. Patients

with NSTE-ACS and those with STEMI should receive secondary pre-
vention approaches as described in Chapters 42, 47, and 52.

SUBGROUPSOFSPECIALINTEREST

OlderAdults
The incidence of ACS increases with age, and given the current demo-
graphic  trends,  elderly  patients  (75  years  of  age)  will  represent  an 
increasing proportion of those with ACS. Yet evidence-based therapies 
are underused in older as opposed to younger patients,170 even when 
considering comorbid conditions and contraindications.171

Elderly  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  present  challenges  to  diagnosis 
and  management,  including  a  greater  likelihood  of  atypical  symp-
toms (e.g., dyspnea, confusion); noncoronary cause of ACS, such as 
hypertension,  myocardial  hypertrophy,  and  diastolic  dysfunction; 
hepatic and renal dysfunction resulting in impaired metabolism and 
decreased clearance of drugs; and comorbid conditions that predis-
pose  to  adverse  reactions,  such  as  bleeding  and  renal  failure  and 
higher risk for ischemic complications.172 The combination of these 
comorbid conditions and a greater tendency to use polypharmacy in 
older  adults  increases  the  risk  for  drug-drug  interactions  and  side 
effects.

In general, pharmacologic treatment of NSTE-ACS in older adults 
should  parallel  the  recommended  therapies  for  younger  patients, 
albeit with greater anticipation of and surveillance for adverse drug 
events.173  The  high  prevalence  of  reduced  renal  function  in  elderly 
individuals,  despite  an  apparently  normal  serum  creatinine  level, 
may lead to excess dosing of antithrombotics such as enoxaparin and 
GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitors.174  Guidelines  recommend  assessment  of  renal 
function (by estimation of either creatinine clearance or the glomeru-
lar filtration rate) in all patients with ACS to permit proper dosing and 
selection of medications.65,75,175

Elderly patients are more likely than younger ones to have severe 
CAD that could benefit from invasive management leading to revas-
cularization.  However,  because  elderly  patients  also  often  have 
medical comorbid conditions that increase the risk for adverse out-
comes and because patients and physicians exercise more caution 
regarding  invasive  procedures,  elderly  patients  have  lower  rates  of 
invasive procedures. Analyses comparing invasive and conservative 
management provide support for the use of an early invasive strategy 
in  elderly  patients  who  do  not  have  contraindications  to  angiogra-
phy,176 particularly if the troponin level is elevated at initial evaluation, 
whereas an early conservative strategy may be preferred in elderly 
patients without troponin elevation.143 Barring comorbid medical con-
ditions that prove to be contraindications, advanced age should not 
deter otherwise indicated comprehensive treatment of NSTE-ACS.

Women(SeealsoChapter77)
Women  are  accounting  for  an  increasingly  larger  proportion  of 
patients with ACS, now approaching 50%.177 On average, women with 
NSTE-ACS tend to be a decade older than men, but management of 
NSTE-ACS should be similar regardless of sex.178 What is considered 
to be the typical manifestation of ACS is based on previous studies 
that  were  conducted  predominantly  in  mensuch  manifestations 
can differ from the more varied findings in women, in whom the chest 
discomfort associated with ACS is more commonly atypical. Nonath-
erosclerotic causes of angina, such as microvascular dysfunction179 
in the coronary circulation without associated epicardial obstructive 
disease and superimposed thrombosis, are more frequent in women.
Women with ACS are also more likely than men to have abnormal 
BNP and hsCRP levels,180 vascular reactivity,181 and functional capac-
ity,182 probably because of the more complex and varied pathophysi-
ology underlying ACS in women.183 Nonetheless, women with elevated 
circulating troponin or with high-risk noninvasive test results should 
be  referred  for  coronary  angiography,  with  the  understanding  that 
they  may  be  at  higher  risk  for  bleeding  complications.  Because 
women with ACS are on average older than men, have lower body 
weight, and are more likely to have impaired renal function, they are 

1171

at particular risk for medication overdose of therapies such as LMWH 
or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.184

Studies investigating the usefulness of intensive DAPT,185 an early 
invasive strategy,147 and the use of high-intensity statins186 in patients 
with  NSTE-ACS  have  challenged  the  concept  that  women  fare  less 
well  than  men  with  the  use  of  standard  intensive  therapies.  These 
findings underscore the view that women and men with NSTE-ACS 
as a result of obstructive CAD should receive similar management.

DiabetesMellitusandGlucoseIntolerance
(SeealsoChapter61)
Diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance are epidemic in the United 
States. An estimated 25.6 million (11.3%) U.S. adults (20 years of age) 
have  diabetes  mellitus,187  and  it  is  undiagnosed  in  approximately  7 
million  of  them.  The  annual  incidence  of  new  cases  of  diabetes  in 
2010  was  1.9  milliondouble  the  rate  30  years  ago.  An  estimated 
additional 35% (79 million) of U.S. adults, as well as half of adults 65 
years or older, have prediabetes (based on elevated fasting glucose 
or hemoglobin A1c levels). Despite advances in management over the 
past three decades, patients with diabetes mellitus continue to expe-
rience  a  threefold  increased  risk  for  age-adjusted  cardiovascular 
mortality  when  compared  with  those  without  diabetes,  and  almost 
five of six patients older than 65 years with diabetes die of some form 
of  heart  or  blood  vessel  disease.177  Thus  patients  with  diabetes  in 
whom NSTE-ACS develops deserve special consideration.

In GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), more than 
a fourth of patients with NSTE-ACS had diabetes.188 Even after multi-
variate  adjustment  for  higher  comorbid  conditions,  diabetes  itself 
confers a 65% increase in the odds for death following NSTE-ACS.189 
Even milder forms of impaired glucose metabolism entail increased 
cardiovascular  risk.  Metabolic  syndrome  was  present  in  25%  of 
patients admitted to the hospital with an ACS in an Israeli national 
survey, and these patients had a doubling of adjusted mortality.190

Patients  with  diabetes  should  receive  established  medical  thera-
pies for NSTE-ACS, as do nondiabetic patients, with additional atten-
tion directed toward control of blood glucose and prevention of acute 
kidney  injury.  Four  key  recommendations  from  an  AHA  scientific 
statement  on  the  management  of  hyperglycemia  in  patients  with 
ACS191 are that (1) plasma glucose should be measured in all patients 
with ACS; (2) in patients in an intensive care or coronary care unit, 
glucose should be monitored closely and intravenous insulin consid-
ered  in  patients  with  blood  glucose  levels  higher  than  180 mg/dL;  
(3)  outside  the  unit,  blood  glucose  should  be  maintained  at  levels 
lower  than  180 mg/dL  with  subcutaneous  insulin;  and  (4)  glucose 
metabolism should be reassessed after discharge in patients without 
previous known diabetes mellitus who demonstrated hyperglycemia 
during hospitalization.

Because patients with diabetes derive similar benefit with an early 
invasive  strategy  as  nondiabetic  patients  do,  diabetes  is  included 
among  the  characteristics  that  should  prompt  adoption  of  an  early 
invasive  strategy.69,75  Patients  with  diabetes  have  a  worse  long-term 
outcome  after  revascularization  than  do  nondiabetic  patients,  par-
ticularly  after  PCI,192  because  they  have  a  higher  risk  for  restenosis 
and  progression  of  disease  in  nonculprit  lesions.  Use  of  GP  IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors  appears  to  have  special  benefit  in  diabetic  patients  who 
undergo  coronary  stenting.193  In  particular,  diabetic  patients  with 
elevated  baseline  glucose  levels  may  merit  the  use  of  more  potent 
platelet  inhibitors  such  as  prasugrel101  (Fig.  53-14)  because  these 
patients have more severe platelet dysfunction.194

ChronicKidneyDisease
(SeealsoChapter88)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that as of 
2010, the prevalence of CKD had increased to 14% in U.S. adults older 
than 20 years.195 Patients with CKD (including those with even minor 
reductions in renal function196) represent a group of special interest 
because  the  risk  for  recurrent  ischemic  events  is  higher  following 
ACS,197 as is treatment-related complications.

Unfortunately,  most  major  cardiovascular  clinical  trials  exclude 
patients with severe CKD, and thus the evidence base for treatment 
recommendations in patients with CKD is limited. A meta-analysis of 
five  trials  of  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  and  CKD  (three  of  the  trials 
excluded  patients  with  severe  renal  dysfunction)  demonstrated 
trends toward more favorable outcomes with an early invasive strat-
egy than with conservative management.144 Thus coronary angiogra-
phy should be considered in patients with CKD, and the benefits of 
prompt  revascularization  should  be  weighed  against  the  risk  for 
bleeding and contrast-induced nephropathy.

Patients  with  CKD  have  a  greater  risk  for  bleeding  because  of 
impaired  platelet  function198  and  because  of  overdosing  with  anti-
thrombotic therapy199 (Table 53-5; also see Table 88-1). In addition, 
patients with CKD have increased risk for contrast-induced nephropa-
thy and acute kidney injury. Current guidelines recommend that the 
risk for contrast-induced nephropathy be assessed by measurement 
of the ratio of contrast volume to creatinine clearance175 and that this 
ratio  not  exceed  3.7.75  Adequate  hydration  in  the  periprocedural 
period is essential,175 but the evidence that isomolar agents are supe-
rior  to  low-osmolar  agents  is  not  compelling.75  Physicians  should 
assess renal function in all patients with NSTE-ACS.6,75 In patients with 
CKD, the dosage of medications that are cleared renally should be

PrinzmetalVariantAngina
In  1959,  Prinzmetal  and  colleagues  described  a  syndrome  of  isch-
emic pain that occurred at rest, accompanied by ST-segment eleva-
tion.200 Prinzmetal variant angina (PVA) may be associated with acute 
MI, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death. 
Spasm of a proximal coronary artery with resultant transmural isch-
emia and abnormalities in left ventricular function are the diagnostic 
hallmarks of PVA. The precise mechanisms responsible for the spasm 
have not been established, but a reduction in nitric oxide production 
by  the  coronary  arterial  endothelium  or  an  imbalance  between 
endothelium-derived  relaxing  and  contracting  factors  may  contrib-
ute.201 The finding of elevated levels of serum hsCRP in many patients 
supports a contribution of inflammation to the condition.202 Polymor-
phisms of the alpha2 presynaptic and the beta2 postsynaptic recep-
tors may also be associated with PVA.203

NO DM

Patients  with  PVA  tend  to  be  younger  than  those  with  NSTE- 
ACS  attributable  to  coronary  atherosclerosis,  and  many  do  not  
exhibit  the  classic  coronary  risk  factors  except  that  they  are  
frequently  heavy  cigarette  smokers. 
The  anginal  pain  is  often  extremely 
severe  and  may  be  accompanied  by 
syncope  related  to  atrioventricular 
block, asystole, or ventricular tachyar-
rhythmia.204  Attacks  of  PVA  tend  to

Approximately a third of patients with 
PVA also exhibit severe fixed coronary 
obstruction  and  may  have  a  combina-
tion  of  exertion-induced  angina  with 
ST-segment  depression  and  episodes  
of angina at rest with ST-segment eleva-
tion. Rarely, PVA appears to be a mani-
festation  of  a  generalized  vasospastic 
disorder associated with migraine and/
or  Raynaud  phenomenon.  PVA  can  
also develop in association with aspirin-
induced  asthma  and  administration  
of  5-fluorouracil  and  cyclophospha-
mide.  The  ergot  derivatives  used  to

DRUG

Enoxaparin

Fondaparinux

Bivalirudin

RECOMMENDATIONS

Dose reduction to 1 mg/kg once daily in the case of severe renal failure (CrCl <30 mL/min)
Consider monitoring anti-Xa activity
Contraindicated in severe renal failure (CrCl <20 mL/min). Drug of choice in patients with moderately reduced renal function (CrCl 

30-60 mL/min)

Patients with moderated renal impairment (30-59 mL/min) should receive an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr. If the creatinine clearance 

is <30 mL/min, reduction of the infusion rate to 1 mg/kg/hr should be considered. No reduction in the bolus dose is needed. 
If a patient is being maintained on hemodialysis, the infusion rate should be reduced to 0.25 mg/kg/hr

Abciximab

No specific recommendations for the use of abciximab or for dose adjustment in the case of renal failure. Careful evaluation of risk 

for hemorrhage is needed before using the drug in patients with renal failure

Eptifibatide

The infusion dose should be reduced to 1 µg/kg/min in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min. The bolus dose remains unchanged at 

180 µg/kg/min. Eptifibatide is contraindicated in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min

Tirofiban

Dose adaptation is required in patients with renal failure; 50% of the bolus dose and infusion is administered if CrCl is <30 mL/min

Recommendations for the use of drugs listed in this table may vary depending on the exact labeling of each drug in the country where it is used. See also Table 88-1.

precipitate episodes of PVA.206 The incidence of PVA has always been 
greater  in  Japan  than  in  Western  countries,  but  across  the  world,  the 
incidence appears to have fallen markedly over the past three decades; 
this decline may be related in part to the more aggressive use of calcium 
antagonists for hypertension.207

The  key  to  diagnosis  of  PVA  lies  in  the  detection  of  episodic 
ST-segment  elevation  often  accompanied  by  severe  chest  pain, 
usually  occurring  at  rest  (Fig.  53-15A)  Multiple  asymptomatic  epi-
sodes  of  (silent)  ST-segment  elevation  occur  in  many  patients. 
ST-segment  deviations  may  be  present  in  any  leads,  depending  on 
the artery involved. Sometimes serious ventricular arrhythmias208 or 
transient  conduction  disturbances209  may  occur  during  periods 
of  ST-segment  elevation  and  result  in  syncope.  Patients  with  no  or 
mild fixed coronary obstruction tend to experience a more benign 
course than do patients with PVA and associated severe obstructive 
lesions.210

Provocative Testing
Three provocative tests for coronary spasm can be performed at the 
time of coronary angiographyhyperventilation (Fig. 53-15B), intra-
coronary  acetylcholine,  and  intracoronary  ergonovinealthough 
the third test is no longer available in the United States. These pro-
vocative  maneuvers  should  be  performed  only  in  patients  without 
obstructive  CAD  and  in  whom  PVA  is  suspected,  but  not  yet  con-
firmed.  Their  use  has  been  declining  over  the  past  two  to  three 
decades,  in  part  related  to  the  induction  of  rare  but  sometimes  

fatal  arrhythmias.  Hyperventilation  may  also  be  performed  with  
electrocardiographic monitoring outside the catheterization labora-
tory,  but  its  sensitivity  is  low  unless  the  attacks  are  very  frequent 
(more than five times per week).

Management
Patients with PVA should be strongly urged to discontinue smoking. 
The mainstay of therapy is a calcium antagonist, alone or usually in 
combination  with  a  long-acting  nitrate.  Sublingual  or  intravenous 
nitroglycerin  often  abolishes  attacks  of  PVA  promptly,  and  long-
acting nitrates are useful in preventing attacks. The response to beta 
blockade in patients with PVA is variable.211 Some patients, particu-
larly those with associated fixed obstructions, exhibit a reduction in 
the frequency of exertion-induced angina caused primarily by aug-
mentation  of  myocardial  oxygen  requirements.  In  others,  however, 
nonselective  beta-blocking  agents  may  actually  be  detrimental 
because blockade of beta2 receptors, which mediate coronary dila-
tion, allows unopposed alpha receptormediated coronary vasocon-
striction to occur.

PCI and occasionally CABG may be helpful in patients with PVA and 
discrete,  proximal  fixed  obstructive  lesions,  but  revascularization  is 
contraindicated  in  patients  with  isolated  coronary  artery  spasm 
without  accompanying  fixed  obstructive  disease.  Patients  who  have 
experienced ischemia-associated ventricular fibrillation and continue 
to  manifest  ischemic  episodes  despite  maximal  medical  treatment 
should receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.212,213

DS: Prinzmetal angina. N Engl J Med 349:e1, 2003.)

Many  patients  with  PVA  pass 
through an acute, active phase, with 
frequent  episodes  of  angina  and 
cardiac events occurring during the 
first  6  months  after  diagnosis.  The 
extent and severity of the underlying 
CAD and the tempo of the syndrome 
have a major effect on the incidence 
of  late  mortality  and  MI.  Remission 
occurs  more  frequently  in  patients 
without  significant  fixed  coronary 
artery  stenoses  and  in  those  who 
have  discontinued  smoking.214  For 
reasons  that  are  not  clear,  some 
patients,  after  a  relatively  quiescent 
period of months or even years, expe-
rience a recrudescence of vasospas-
tic activity with frequent and severe 
episodes  of  ischemia.  Fortunately, 
these  patients  generally  respond  to 
retreatment  with  calcium  antago-
nists and nitrates. Clinical outcomes 
are excellent in patients with isolated 
coronary  spasm  and  no  underlying 
CAD,  with  no  cardiac  death  or  MI 
occurring  in  76  patients  monitored 
for 3 years in the CASPAR (Coronary 
Artery Spasm in Patients with Acute 
Coronary Syndrome) study, although 
about half of the patients frequently 
experienced angina.215

CardiacSyndromeX
Approximately  15%  of  patients  with 
NSTE-ACS  have  no  obstructive  epi-
cardial  disease,  although  they  may 
have  electrocardiographic  evidence 
of myocardial ischemia. This condi-
tion,  commonly 
to  as 
cardiac syndrome X, is described in 
Chapter 77. It must be distinguished 
from  metabolic  syndrome  X,  dis-
cussed in Chapter 42.

CocaineandAmphetamines
(SeealsoChapter68)
Cocaine use causes a marked increase in sympathetic tone by block-
ing the reuptake of norepinephrine from synapses by preganglionic 
neurons, thereby resulting in increased myocardial oxygen demand 
and decreased supply.216 This may cause acute myocardial ischemia 
and be manifested as an ACS. This condition, which has similar find-
ings  as  amphetamine  abuse,  occurs  more  frequently  in  younger 
persons and should be especially considered in males younger than 
30  years.217  The  use  of  psychoactive  street  drugs  known  as  bath 
salts that contain synthetic cathinones with cocaine-like actions may 
also cause cardiovascular complications, including ACS.218

FUTUREPERSPECTIVES

Several aspects of the diagnosis and management of NSTE-ACS will 
continue  to  advance  rapidly  and  will  probably  affect  numerous 
aspects of patient care, including the classification, risk assessment, 
prognostication, and management of patients with NSTE-ACS. With 
future  development  and  more  widespread  use  of  more  sensitive 
assays  of  cTn,  it  is  likely  that  some  myocardial  necrosis  will  be 
detected  in  a  large  majority  of  patients  with  NSTE-ACS.  Hence  the 
frequency  of  diagnosis  of  UA  will  continue  to  decline  and  more  of 
these  patients  will  meet  the  criteria  for  NSTEMI.  Newer  biomarkers 
emerging from proteomic techniques will allow identification of spe-
cific causes of NSTE-ACS, which in turn will result in more specific 
and  individualized  treatment  (see  Chapter  10).  Improvements  in 
noninvasive plaque imaging will lead to the rapid exclusion of ACS 
when  the  diagnosis  is  uncertain  and  to  more  rapid  and  accurate 
assessment  of  coronary  obstruction  and  detection  of  vulnerable 
plaque.

As new pharmacologic agents that target different aspects of the 
clotting  cascade  and  platelet  function  are  developed,  additional 
therapeutic  options  will  become  available  and  allow  clinicians  to 
select  more  effective  and  safer  combinations  directed  toward  indi-
vidual  patients  needs.  Newer  generations  of  intracoronary  stents 
under development, including totally resorbable stents, may further 
reduce the risk for restenosis and stent thrombosisthereby leading 
to shorter periods of antithrombotic therapy, which will reduce the 
incidence of bleeding.

Several new therapies are now undergoing phase III trials. These 
include new, powerful drugs to reduce LDL cholesterol and raise the 
HDL  cholesterol  concentration  profoundly  (see  Chapters  42  and 
45).  Similarly,  new  interventions  are  under  evaluation  for  the  treat-
ment  of  resistant  hypertension  (see  Chapter  44).  Judicious  use  of 
these new treatments will probably further reduce the development 
of initial and recurrent episodes of NSTE-ACS.

Specific populations at highest risk for NSTE-ACS have been identi-
fied. These groups also paradoxically tend to be undertreated with 
existing  proven  therapies.  We  anticipate  that  special  effort  will  be 
made  to  identify  these  patients  and  to  intensify  both  primary  and 
secondary prevention.

As treatment plans become more diverse, more sophisticated elec-
tronic information systems will help guide care. To ensure optimal, 
personalized  management  of  patients  with  NSTE-ACS,  appropriate 
use and analysis of electronic medical records will in turn allow more 
accurate assessment of outcomes and improve the quality of care.

GUIDELINES
UnstableAnginaandNonST
ElevationMyocardialInfarction
Robert P. Giugliano and Eugene Braunwald

In 2012 the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and 
American Heart Association (AHA) published a focused update on 

practice  guidelines  for  the  management  of  patients  with  unstable 
angina (UA) and nonST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI),1,2 
also referred to as nonST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-
ACS). The 2012 update, which replaced the previous years focused 
update3 to the 2007 full guidelines,4 reflects the rapid accumulation 
of new information related to antithrombotic therapy, timing of inva-
sive  management,  secondary  prevention,  and  treatment  of  special 
subgroups (specifically in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney 
disease [CKD]). This guideline summary highlights the major updates

to the guidelines, with the standard ACCF/AHA classification system 
being  used  for  indications  (classes  I  to  III)  and  level  of  evidence  
(A to C).2

INITIALEVALUATIONANDMANAGEMENT

Patients who experience symptoms suggestive of ACS should not be 
evaluated by telephone but instead should be referred to a medical 
facility  that  permits  examination  by  a  physician,  assessment  of  a 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory testing for cardiac 
biomarkers of necrosis (class I; level of evidence: C). Figure 53G-1 
presents  an  updated  detailed  algorithm  for  the  initial  evaluation, 
triage, and management of patients with suspected ACS.

EARLYRISKSTRATIFICATION

ClassIRecommendations
1.  Rapid clinical determination of risk for obstructive coronary artery 
disease (CAD) (i.e., high, intermediate, or low) should be made in all 
patients  with  chest  discomfort  or  other  symptoms  suggestive  of  an 
ACS and considered in patient management. (Level of evidence: C.)
2.  Patients with chest discomfort or other ischemic symptoms should 
undergo  early  risk  stratification  for  cardiovascular  events  (e.g., 
death or repeated myocardial infarction [MI]) that focuses on the 

history,  including  anginal  symptoms,  findings  on  the  physical 
examination,  findings  on  the  ECG,  and  biomarkers  of  cardiac 
injury,  and  the  results  should  be  considered  in  patient  manage-
ment. (Level of evidence: C.)

3.  A 12-lead ECG should be obtained and shown to an experienced 
emergency physician as soon as possible after arrival at the emer-
gency department (ED), with a goal of 10 minutes within ED arrival 
for  all  patients  with  chest  discomfort  (or  anginal  equivalent)  or 
other symptoms suggestive of ACS. (Level of evidence: B.)

4.  If the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symp-
tomatic and ACS is highly suspected clinically, serial ECGs, initially 
at  15-  to  30-minute  intervals,  should  be  obtained  to  detect  the 
potential for development of ST-segment elevation or depression. 
(Level of evidence: B.)

5.  Cardiac biomarkers should be measured in all patients with chest 

discomfort consistent with an ACS. (Level of evidence: B.)

6.  A  cardiac-specific  troponin  is  the  preferred  marker,  and  if  avail-
able, it should be measured in all patients with chest discomfort 
consistent with an ACS. (Level of evidence: B.)

7.  Patients  with  negative  cardiac  biomarkers  within  6  hours  of  the 
onset of symptoms consistent with an ACS should have biomarkers 
remeasured in the time frame of 8 to 12 hours after symptom onset. 
(Level of evidence: B.)

8.  The  initial  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  a  suspected  ACS  should 
include consideration of noncoronary causes of the development 
of unexplained symptoms. (Level of evidence: C.)

IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin 
Therapy)  risk  model,  can  be  useful  to  assist  in  decision  making 
with regard to treatment options in patients with a suspected ACS. 
(Level of evidence: B.)

2.  It is reasonable to remeasure positive biomarkers at 6- to 8-hour inter-
vals two to three times or until the levels have peaked as an index of 
infarct size and dynamics of the necrosis. (Level of evidence: B.)

3.  It is reasonable to obtain supplemental ECG leads V7 through V9 in 
patients whose initial ECG is nondiagnostic to rule out MI secondary 
to occlusion of the left circumflex artery. (Level of evidence: B.)

4.  Continuous monitoring of the 12-lead ECG is a reasonable alterna-
tive  to  serial  12-lead  recordings  in  patients  whose  initial  ECG  is 
nondiagnostic. (Level of evidence: B.)

ClassIIb
1.  For patients seen within 6 hours of symptoms suggestive of an ACS, 
a 2-hour change in the MB fraction of creatine kinase in conjunc-
tion with a 2-hour change in troponin may be considered. (Level 
of evidence: B.)

2.  Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NT-pro-BNP 
may  be  considered  to  supplement  assessment  of  global  risk  in 
patients with suspected ACS. (Level of evidence: B.)

EARLYHOSPITALCARE

The  class  I  recommendations  for  anti-ischemic  therapy  in  the  2012 
guideline  update  are  similar  to  those  in  previous  guidelines  and 
include continuous monitoring of the ECG, supplemental oxygen in 
selected  patients  with  hypoxemia  or  respiratory  distress,  nitrates, 
beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angio-
tensin receptor blockers. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other 
than aspirin should not be used because they increase risk for mortal-
ity, reinfarction, hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial rupture.
Three  important  changes  were  made  in  the  recommendations 
regarding oral antiplatelet therapy in the guideline update, namely, (1) 
addition of prasugrel as an option in patients managed by percutane-
ous coronary intervention (PCI), (2) addition of ticagrelor in patients 
managed medically or with an invasive strategy, and (3) modification 
of the duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy to up to 12 months after an 
NSTE-ACS.  In  contrast,  recommendations  regarding  anticoagulation 
therapy did not change substantially in the 2012 update.

INITIALCONSERVATIVEVERSUS
INVASIVESTRATEGIES

ClassI
1.  An early invasive strategy is indicated in patients with UA/NSTEMI 
who have refractory angina or hemodynamic or electrical instabil-
ity  (without  serious  comorbid  conditions  or  contraindications  to 
such procedures). (Level of evidence: B.)

2.  An early invasive strategy (i.e., diagnostic angiography with intent 
to  perform  revascularization)  is  indicated  in  initially  stabilized 
patients with UA/NSTEMI (without serious comorbid conditions or 
contraindications to such procedures) who have elevated risk for 
clinical  events  (level  of  evidence:  A).  To  assess  clinical  risk,  the 
guidelines endorse the use of a risk stratification model such as 
the TIMI5 or GRACE6 risk score or the PRUSUIT risk model.7 (Class 
IIa, level of evidence: B.)

ClassIIa
1.  It is reasonable to choose an early invasive strategy (within 12 to 
24 hours of admission) for initially stabilized high-risk patients with 
UA/NSTEMI.  For  patients  not  at  high  risk,  a  delayed  invasive 
approach is also reasonable. (Level of evidence: B.)

1179

ClassIIb
1.  In initially stabilized patients, an initially conservative (i.e., a selec-
tively invasive) strategy may be considered as a treatment strategy 
for  patients  with  UA/NSTEMI  (without  serious  comorbid  condi-
tions or contraindications to such procedures) who have elevated 
risk for clinical events, including those who are troponin positive.

1.  An early invasive strategy (i.e., diagnostic angiography with intent 
to perform revascularization) is not recommended in patients with 
extensive  comorbid  conditions  (e.g.,  liver  or  pulmonary  failure, 
cancer) in whom the risks associated with revascularization and 
comorbid conditions are likely to outweigh the benefits of revas-
cularization. (Level of evidence: C.)

2.  An early invasive strategy (i.e., diagnostic angiography with intent to 
perform  revascularization)  is  not  recommended  in  patients  with 
acute chest pain and low likelihood of an ACS. (Level of evidence: C.)
3.  An early invasive strategy (i.e., diagnostic angiography with intent 
to perform revascularization) should not be performed in patients 
who  will  not  consent  to  revascularization  regardless  of  the  find-
ings. (Level of evidence: C.)

surgical and percutaneous coronary revascularization.

LONG-TERMMEDICALTHERAPY
ANDSECONDARYPREVENTION

AntiplateletTherapy
1.  For patients with UA/NSTEMI treated medically without stenting, 
aspirin (or a thienopyridine in patients with aspirin allergy) should 
be  prescribed  indefinitely.  (Level  of  evidence:  A.)  Clopidogrel 
(75 mg/day)  or  ticagrelor  (90 mg  twice  daily,  the  aspirin  dose 
should not exceed 100 mg daily) should be prescribed for up to 
12 months. (Level of evidence: B.)

2.  For patients with UA/NSTEMI treated with a stent (bare-metal stent 
BMS]  or  drug-eluting  stent  [DES]),  aspirin  should  be  continued 
indefinitely (level of evidence: A). The duration and maintenance 
dose of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy should be as follows:
a.  Clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, prasugrel, 10 mg daily (consider 5 mg 
in  patients  weighing <60 kg),  or  ticagrelor,  90 mg  twice  daily, 
should be given for at least 12 months in patients receiving DESs 
and  up  to  12  months  for  those  receiving  BMSs.  (Level  of  evi­
dence: B.)

b.  If  the  risk  for  morbidity  because  of  bleeding  outweighs  the 
anticipated benefits afforded by P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy, 
earlier  discontinuation  should  be  considered.  (Level  of  evi­
dence: C.)

3.  Clopidogrel,  75 mg  daily  (level  of  evidence:  B),  prasugrel,  10 mg 
daily (in PCI-treated patients) (level of evidence: C), or ticagrelor, 
90 mg twice daily (level of evidence: C), should be given to patients 
recovering  from  UA/NSTEMI  when  aspirin  is  contraindicated  or 
not tolerated because of hypersensitivity or gastrointestinal intoler-
ance  (despite  the  use  of  gastroprotective  agents  such  as  proton 
pump inhibitors).

Class IIa
1.  After PCI it is reasonable to use 81 mg/day of aspirin in preference 

to higher maintenance doses. (Level of evidence: B.)

ClassIIb
1.  For patients with UA/NSTEMI who have an indication for antico-
agulation, addition of warfarin may be reasonable to maintain an

international  normalized  ratio  [INR]  of  2.0  to  3.0.  (Level  of  evi­
dence: B.) A target INR of 2.0 to 2.5 is preferable while giving dual 
antiplatelet  therapy,  especially  in  older  patients  and  those  at 
increased risk for bleeding.

Warfarin
Class I
1.  Use of warfarin in conjunction with aspirin and/or P2Y12 receptor 
inhibitor therapy is associated with an increased risk for bleeding, 
and patients and clinicians should watch for bleeding, especially 
gastrointestinal  bleeding,  and  seek  medical  evaluation  for  evi-
dence of bleeding. (Level of evidence: A.)

SPECIALGROUPS

DiabetesMellitus
Class I
1.  Medical treatment in the acute phase of UA/NSTEMI and decisions 
on whether to perform stress testing, angiography, and revascular-
ization  should  be  similar  in  patients  with  and  without  diabetes 
mellitus. (Level of evidence: A.)

Class IIa
1.  For  patients  with  UA/NSTEMI  and  multivessel  disease,  coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG) with use of the internal mammary 
arteries can be more beneficial than PCI in patients being treated 
for diabetes mellitus. (Level of evidence: B.)

2.  PCI  is  reasonable  for  UA/NSTEMI  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus, 
single-vessel disease, and inducible ischemia. (Level of evidence: B.)

ChronicKidneyDisease
Class I
1.  Creatinine  clearance  should  be  estimated  in  patients  with  UA/
NSTEMI,  and  doses  of  renally  cleared  medications  should  be 
adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic data for specific medi-
cations. (Level of evidence: B.)

2.  Patients  undergoing  cardiac  catheterization  with  contrast  media 
should  receive  adequate  preparatory  hydration.  (Level  of  evi­
dence: B.)

3.  Calculation of the contrast volumetocreatinine clearance ratio 
is useful to predict the maximum volume of contrast media that 
can be given without significantly increasing the risk for contrast-
induced nephropathy. (Level of evidence: B.)

Class IIa
1.  An invasive strategy is reasonable for patients with mild (stage 2) and 
moderate (stage 3) CKD. (Level  of  evidence:  B.) (There are insuffi-
cient data on the benefit or risk associated with an invasive strategy 
in patients with UA/NSTEMI and advanced CKD [stages 4 and 5].)
