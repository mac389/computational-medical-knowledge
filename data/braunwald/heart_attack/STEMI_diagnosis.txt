Pathologic diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) requires evidence 
of myocardial cell death caused by ischemia. Characteristic findings 
include  coagulation  necrosis  and  contraction  band  necrosis,  often 
with  patchy  areas  of  myocytolysis  at  the  periphery  of  the  infarct. 
During the acute phase of MI, myocytes die in the infarct zone, with 
subsequent  inflammation,  clearance  of  necrotic  debris,  and  repair 
eventuating in scar formation.

Clinical diagnosis of MI requires a clinical syndrome indicative of 
myocardial ischemia with some combination of evidence of myocar-
dial  necrosis  on  biochemical,  electrocardiographic,  or  imaging 
modalities.  The  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  clinical  tools  for 
diagnosing MI vary considerably depending on the timing of evalua-
tion after the onset of infarction. Cardiac professional societies have 
jointly  established  updated  criteria  for  the  diagnosis  of  MI  (Table 
51-1).1 The revised universal definition of myocardial infarction clas-
sifies  MI  into  five  types,  depending  on  the  circumstances  in  which 
the MI occurs (Table 51-2).1 These revisions to the definition of MI 
and  a  shift  to  more  sensitive  biomarkers  of  myocardial  injury  have 
important implications not only for the clinical care of patients but 
also for epidemiologic study, public policy, and clinical trials.2,3

The contemporary approach to patients with ischemic discomfort 
is to consider them to be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS), which encompasses the diagnoses of unstable angina, non
ST-segment  elevation  MI  (NSTEMI),  and  ST-segment  elevation  MI 
(STEMI) (Fig.  51-1). The principal diagnostic tool for patients with 
suspected  ACS  is  the  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  which  dis-
criminates those with ST-segment elevation, the subject of Chapters 
51  and  52,  and  those  without  ST-segment  elevation,  the  subject  of 
Chapter 53.

CHANGINGPATTERNSININCIDENCE
ANDCARE

Despite  advances  in  diagnosis  and  management,  STEMI  remains  a 
major public health problem in the industrialized world and is on the 
rise in developing countries (see Chapter 1).4 In the United States, 
almost 600,000 patients are admitted to the hospital each year with 
a primary diagnosis of ACS. The number exceeds 1 million with the 
inclusion  of  ACS  as  a  secondary  diagnosis.5  The  rate  of  MI  rises 
sharply in both men and women with increasing age, and racial dif-
ferences exist, with MI occurring more frequently in black men and 
women regardless of age. The proportion of patients with ACS events 
who  have  STEMI  varies  across  observational  studiesfrom  29%  to 
47%  of  patients  admitted  with  ACS.  This  estimate  does  not  include 
silent MI, which may not prompt hospitalization. Between 1999 and 

1068

2008, the proportion of patients with an ACS and STEMI declined by 
almost 50% (Fig. 51-2A; see also Fig. 53-2).6

Of particular concern from a global perspective, the burden of MI 
in  developing  countries  may  be  approaching  that  now  afflicting 
developed countries.4 The limited resources available to treat STEMI 
in  developing  countries  mandate  major  international  efforts  to 
strengthen primary prevention programs (see also Chapter 1).

IMPROVEMENTSINOUTCOME

The overall number of deaths from STEMI has declined steadily over 
the  past  30  years,  but  it  has  stabilized  over  the  past  decade  (Fig. 
51-2B).6-9  Both  a  decreased  incidence  of  STEMI  and  a  decline  in  the 
case fatality rate after STEMI have contributed to this trend.5 According 
to estimates from the American Heart Association, the short-term mor-
tality rate of patients with STEMI ranges from 5% to 6% during the initial 
hospitalization and from 7% to 18% at 1 year.10 Mortality rates in clinical 
trial  populations  tend  to  be  approximately  half  of  those  observed  in 
registries of consecutive patients, most likely because of the exclusion 
of patients with more extensive comorbid medical conditions.

Improvements  in  the  management  of  patients  with  STEMI  have 
occurred  in  several  phases.11  The  clinical  observation  phase  of 
coronary care consumed the first half of the 20th century and focused 
on detailed recording of physical and laboratory findings, with little 
active  treatment  of  the  infarction.  The  coronary  care  unit  phase 
began in the mid-1960s and emphasized early detection and manage-
ment of cardiac arrhythmias based on the development of monitor-
ing and cardioversion/defibrillation capabilities. The high-technology 
phase, heralded by the introduction of the pulmonary artery balloon 
flotation catheter, set the stage for bedside hemodynamic monitoring 
and directed hemodynamic management. The modern reperfusion 
era  of  STEMI  care  began  with  intracoronary  and  then  intravenous 
fibrinolysis,  increased  use  of  aspirin  (see Chapter  52),  and  subse-
quently the development of primary percutaneous coronary interven-
tion (PCI) (see Chapter 55).

Contemporary  care  of  patients  with  STEMI  has  entered  an 
evidence-based coronary care phase, which is increasingly being 
influenced by guidelines and performance measures for clinical prac-
tice.10,12,13  Implementation  of  guideline-directed  medical  treatment 
(GDMT) and regional quality initiatives has significantly decreased 
heterogeneity  in  care,  increased  compliance  with  evidence-based 
therapies, and improved outcomes.14,15 Mandatory outcome and pro-
cedural reporting has resulted in the establishment of benchmarks 
for procedural success and mortality rates in patients with MI cared 
for at various hospitals (www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov).

TABLE51-1  Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction

Criteria for Acute Myocardial Infarction

The term acute MI should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. Under 
these conditions any of the following criteria meet the diagnosis for MI:
  Detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac biomarker values (preferably cTn), with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the URL and with at least 

one of the following:
  Symptoms of ischemia
  New or presumed new significant ST-segment T wave (ST-T) changes or new LBBB
  Development of pathologic Q waves on the ECG
  Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality
  Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy

  Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic changes on the ECG or new LBBB but death occurred 

1069

before cardiac biomarkers were determined or before cardiac biomarker values would be increased.

  PCI-related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values (to >5 × the 99th percentile of the URL) in patients with normal baseline values (99th 

percentile of the URL) or a rise in cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (1) symptoms suggestive 
of myocardial ischemia, (2) new ischemic changes on the ECG, (3) angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication, or  
(4) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality is required.

  Stent thrombosis associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall 

in cardiac biomarker values and at least one value higher than the 99th percentile of the URL.

  CABG-related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values (to >10 × the 99th percentile of the URL) in patients with normal baseline cTn 
values (99th percentile of the URL). In addition, either (1) new pathologic Q waves or new LBBB, (2) angiographically documented new graft or new native 
coronary artery occlusion, or (3) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality is required.

Criteria for Previous Myocardial Infarction

Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior MI: 
  Pathologic Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of nonischemic causes
  Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract in the absence of a nonischemic cause
  Pathologic findings of previous MI

CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; cTn = cardiac troponin; LBBB = left bundle branch block; URL = upper reference limit.

TABLE51-2  Universal Myocardial Infarction Classification of Type

Type 1: Spontaneous Myocardial Infarction

Spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, erosion, or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more 

of the coronary arteries that leads to decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli with ensuing myocyte necrosis. The patient may have 
underlying severe CAD but on occasion nonobstructive or no CAD.

Type 2: Myocardial Infarction Secondary to Ischemic Imbalance

In instances of myocardial injury with necrosis in which a condition other than CAD contributes to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or 

demand, e.g., coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, coronary embolism, tachyarrhythmias/bradyarrhythmias, anemia, respiratory 
failure, hypotension, and hypertension with or without LV hypertrophy.

Type 3: Myocardial Infarction Resulting in Death When Biomarker Values Are Unavailable

Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic changes on the ECG or new LBBB but death occurring before 

blood samples could be obtained, before cardiac biomarkers could rise, or in rare cases, when cardiac biomarkers were not collected.

Type 4a: Myocardial Infarction Related to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
MI associated with PCI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values to >5 × the 99th percentile of the URL in patients with normal baseline values (99th 
percentile of the URL) or a rise in cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (1) symptoms suggestive 
of myocardial ischemia, (2) new ischemic changes on the ECG or new LBBB, (3) angiographic loss of patency of a major coronary artery or a side branch 
or persistent slow flow or no flow or embolization, or (4) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion 
abnormality is required.

Type 4b: Myocardial Infarction Related to Stent Thrombosis

MI associated with stent thrombosis is detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall in 

cardiac biomarkers values with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the URL.

Type 5: Myocardial Infarction Related to Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
MI associated with CABG is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values to >10 × the 99th percentile of the URL in patients with normal 

baseline cTn values (<99th percentile of the URL). In addition, either (1) new pathologic Q waves or new LBBB, (2) angiographically documented new graft or 
new native coronary artery occlusion, or (3) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality is required.

CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; CAD = coronary artery disease; cTn = cardiac troponin; LBBB = left bundle branch block; URL = upper reference limit.

LimitationsofCurrentTherapy
Rates  of  appropriate  initiation  of  reperfusion  therapy  vary  widely, 
with  up  to  30%  of  patients  with  STEMI  who  are  eligible  to  receive 
reperfusion  therapy  not  receiving  this  lifesaving  treatment  in  some 
registries.16 Therefore initiatives to increase timely administration of 
guideline-directed  reperfusion  therapy  are  important  to  achieve 
improvements in care (see Chapter 52).

Advanced  age  is  a  principal  determinant  of  mortality  in  patients 
with STEMI.17,18 Cardiac catheterization and other invasive procedures 
are  being  performed  more  commonly  during  hospitalization  in 
elderly  patients  with  STEMI.  Nevertheless,  evidence  suggests  that  
the  greatest  reductions  in  mortality  in  elderly  patients  are  gained  
by  strategies  used  during  the  first  24  hours,  a  time  frame  in  which 
prompt  and  appropriate  use  of  lifesaving  reperfusion  therapy  is

FIGURE51-1  Myocardial ischemia and infarction. Myocardial ischemia and infarction can result from various coronary disease processes, including vasospasm, increased 
myocardial demand in the setting of a fixed coronary lesion, and erosion or rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque leading to acute thrombus formation and subse-
quent ischemia. All result in myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch and can precipitate ischemic symptoms, and all processes, when severe or prolonged, will lead 
to myocardial necrosis or infarction. Nonthrombotically mediated events (bottom half, left side) typically occur without ST-segment elevations on the ECG but can have 
elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers if the ischemia is severe and long enough, in which case they are classified as having type II MI. The atherothrombotic lesion is the 
hallmark pathobiologic event of an ACS. The reduction in flow may be caused by a completely occlusive thrombus (bottom half, right side) or by a subtotally occlusive 
thrombus  (bottom  half,  middle).  Ischemic  discomfort  may  occur  with  or  without  ST-segment  elevation  on  the  ECG.  Of  patients  with  ST-segment  elevation,  Q-wave  MI 
ultimately develop in most, whereas nonQ-wave MI develops in a few. Patients without ST-segment elevation are suffering from either unstable angina or NSTEMI, a 
distinction that is ultimately made by the presence or absence of a serum cardiac marker such as CK-MB or cardiac troponin detected in blood. NonQ-wave MI ultimately 
develops in most patients with NSTEMI on the ECG; Q-wave MI may develop in a few. MI that develops as the result of the atherothrombotic lesion of an ACS is classified 
as type I MI. (Modified from Thygesen K, Alpert JS, Jaffe AS, et al: Third universal definition of myocardial infarction. J Am Coll Cardiol 60:1581, 2012.)

paramountthus  emphasizing  the  need  to  extend  advances  in 
GDMT for STEMI to older adults.19

Management  and  outcomes  of  patients  with  STEMI  appear  to  
vary substantially depending on the volume of such patients cared 
for  within  a  hospital  system.20,21  Mortality  rates  in  patients  with 
STEMI  are  lower  in  hospitals  with  a  high  clinical  volume,  a  high  
rate  of  invasive  procedures,  and  a  top  ranking  in  quality  reports. 
Conversely,  patients  with  STEMI  not  cared  for  by  a  cardiovascular 
specialist  have  higher  mortality  rates.  Variation  also  occurs  in  the 
treatment  patterns  of  certain  population  subgroups  with  STEMI, 
notably  women  and  blacks,  although  after  adjusting  for  comorbid 

conditions  and  the  degree  of  atherosclerosis,  outcomes  appear  to  
be similar.22

PATHOLOGICFINDINGS

Based  on  research  beginning  in  the  1970s,  we  now  recognize  that 
almost all ACS events result from coronary atherosclerosis, generally 
with superimposed coronary thrombosis caused by rupture or erosion 
of  an  atherosclerotic  lesion.23,24  Nonatherogenic  forms  of  coronary 
artery  disease  are  discussed  later  in  this  chapter,  and  causes  of  MI 
without coronary atherosclerosis are presented in Table 51-3.

When  acute  coronary  athero-
thrombosis  occurs, 
the  resulting 
intracoronary thrombus may be par-
tially  obstructive,  which  generally 
leads to myocardial ischemia in the 
absence of ST-segment elevation, or 
be  completely  occlusive  and  cause 
transmural  myocardial 
ischemia 
and  STEMI.  Before  the  fibrinolytic 
era,  clinicians 
typically  divided 
patients with MI into those in whom 
a Q wave developed on the ECG and 
those with nonQ-wave MI based on 
evolution  of  the  ECG  pattern  over 
several days. The term Q-wave infarc-
tion  was  frequently  considered  to 
be virtually synonymous with trans-
mural  infarction,  whereas  nonQ-
wave infarctions were often referred 
to  as  subendocardial 
infarctions. 
Contemporary studies using cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR) indicate 
that  the  development  of  a  Q  wave  
on  the  ECG  is  determined  more  by 
the  size  of  the  infarct  than  by  the 
depth  of  mural  involvement.  Thus 
use of ACS as the more appropriate 
broad  conceptual  framework  has 
replaced this terminology, anchored 
by  the  underlying  unifying  patho-
physiology  (see  Fig.  51-1).  Further 
classification  of  patients  by  the  
presence  of  ST-segment  elevation 
(STEMI)  or  by  its  absence  (non
ST-segment  elevation  ACS)  rather 
than by the evolution of Q waves is 
preferable because immediate clini-
cal decisions such as fibrinolysis or 
primary  PCI  depend  on  identifica-
tion of diagnostic ST-segment elevation on the initial ECG.

FIGURE 51-3  Schematic  representation  of  the  progression  of  myocardial  necrosis  after  coronary  artery  occlusion. 
Necrosis begins in a small zone of the myocardium beneath the endocardial surface in the center of the ischemic zone. 
This entire region of myocardium (dashed outline) depends on the occluded vessel for perfusion and is the area at risk. A 
narrow zone of myocardium immediately beneath the endocardium is spared from necrosis because it can be oxygenated 
by  diffusion  from  the  ventricle.  (From  Schoen  FJ:  The  heart.  In  Kumar  V,  Abbas  AK,  Fausto  N  [eds]:  Robbins  &  Cotran 
Pathologic Basis of Disease. 8th ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 2009.)

Plaque(SeealsoChapter41)
Atherosclerotic  plaque  begins  early  in  life  and  grows  slowly  over 
decades.25 Evidence of some atherosclerosis is almost ubiquitous in 
the modern world, yet most plaque remains asymptomatic through-
out  a  lifetime.  Other  plaques  may  develop  slowly  and  elicit  stable 
symptoms. Plaque that precipitates an ACS event through the abrupt 
and catastrophic transition from a vulnerable, yet stable plaque to an 
unstable one characterized by plaque disruption or erosion and then 
subsequent  overlying  thrombosis  is  rare.23,26  Traditional  risk  factors 
and consequent chronic inflammation promote much of the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis, although some patients have a systemic pre-
disposition to plaque disruption that is independent of traditional risk 
factors. Plaque disruption exposes substances that promote platelet 
activation  and  aggregation,  thrombin  generation,  and  ultimately 
thrombus formation.23,26 The resultant thrombus interrupts blood flow 
and  leads  to  an  imbalance  between  oxygen  supply  and  demand  
and, if this imbalance is severe and persistent, to myocardial necrosis 
(Fig. 51-3).

Composition of Plaque
The  atherosclerotic  plaque  associated  with  total  thrombotic  occlu-
sion  of  an  epicardial  coronary  artery,  located  in  infarct-related 
vessels, is generally more complex and irregular than the plaque in 
vessels  not  associated  with  STEMI.23,26  Histologic  studies  of  these 
lesions  often  reveal  plaque  rupture  or  erosion  (see  Chapter  41). 
Thrombus  composition  may  vary  at  different  levels:  white  thrombi 
contain  platelets,  fibrin,  or  both,  and  red  thrombi  contain  erythro-
cytes, fibrin, platelets, and leukocytes (see Chapter 82).

Plaque Fissuring and Disruption
In autopsy studies, plaque rupture and plaque erosion are the most 
common underlying causes of MI and sudden cardiac death. Plaque 
rupture  is  present  in  almost  three  quarters  of  cases  and  is  more 
prevalent in men. Plaque erosion is more frequent in women younger 
than  50  years,  although  the  prevalence  of  rupture  increases  as 
women age.23 Atherosclerotic plaque considered prone to disruption 
or erosion is most likely plaque that has evolved to a morphology that 
includes a necrotic core filled with lipids and inflammatory cells and 
covered by a thin and inflamed fibrous cap. A prospective study of 
697 patients with ACS who underwent three-vessel coronary angiog-
raphy and gray-scale radiofrequency intravascular ultrasonographic 
imaging  after  PCI  found  that  three  lesion  characteristicslipid 
burden greater than 70%, thin-cap fibroatheroma morphology, and a 
minimal  luminal  area  of  4.0 mm2  or  smallerwere  independent 
correlates  of  future  atherosclerotic  events  (Fig.  51-4).27  Other 
morphologic  characteristics  associated  with  rupture-prone  plaque 
include  expansive  remodeling  that  minimizes  luminal  obstruction 
(mild  stenosis  by  angiography),  neovascularization  (angiogenesis), 
plaque hemorrhage, adventitial inflammation, and a spotty pattern 
of calcification.23

Inflammation  stimulates  the  overexpression  of  enzymes  that 
degrade  components  of  the  plaques  extracellular  matrix.23,26  Acti-
vated  macrophages  and  mast  cells,  abundant  at  the  site  of  plaque 
disruption in patients who die of STEMI, can elaborate these protein-
ases. In addition to these structural aspects of vulnerable or high-risk 
plaque, stress induced by intraluminal pressure, coronary vasomotor 
tone, tachycardia (cyclical stretching and compression), and disrup-
tion  of  microvessels  combines  to  produce  plaque  disruption  at  the 
margin of the fibrous cap near an adjacent, less involved segment of 
the coronary artery wall (shoulder region of the plaque).25 Several key

seasonal variations and increase at times of stress. These factors act 
in concert to heighten the propensity for plaque disruption and coro-
nary  thrombosis,  with  the  result  that  STEMI  clusters  in  the  early 
morning hours, especially in the winter and after natural disasters.28-30

Acute Coronary Syndromes
Plaque  disruption  exposes  thrombogenic  substances  that  may 
produce an extensive thrombus in the infarct-related artery (see Fig. 
51-1).  An  adequate  collateral  network  that  prevents  necrosis  from 
occurring can result in clinically silent episodes of coronary occlu-
sion;  in  addition,  many  plaque  ruptures  are  asymptomatic  if  the 
thrombosis is not occlusive. Characteristically, completely occlusive 
thrombi lead to transmural injury to the ventricular wall in the myo-
cardial bed subtended by the affected coronary artery (Fig. 51-5; see 
also Figs. 51-1 and 51-3). Infarction alters the sequence of depolariza-
tion ultimately reflected as changes in the QRS.31 The most charac-
teristic change in the QRS that develops in most patients with STEMI 
is the evolution of Q waves in leads overlying the infarct zone (see 
Figs. 51-1 and 51-5).31 In a minority of patients with ST elevation, no 
Q waves develop but other abnormalities in the QRS complex occur 
frequently,  such  as  diminution  in  R  wave  height  and  notching  or 
splintering of the QRS (see Chapter 12). Patients who have ischemic 
symptoms  without  ST  elevation  are  initially  diagnosed  as  suffering 
either from unstable angina or, with evidence of myocardial necrosis, 
from NSTEMI (see Fig. 51-1).

Patients  with  persistent  ST-segment  elevation  are  candidates  for 
reperfusion  therapy  (either  pharmacologic  or  catheter  based)  to 
restore  flow  in  the  occluded  epicardial  infarct-related  artery  (see 
Chapter  52).10  ACS  patients  without  ST-segment  elevation  are  not 
candidates  for  pharmacologic  reperfusion  but  should  receive  anti-
ischemic therapy, followed in most cases by PCI (see Chapter 53). 
Thus the 12-lead ECG remains at the center of the decision pathway 
for  the  management  of  patients  with  ACS  to  distinguish  between 
those  with  ST  elevation  and  those  without  it  (see  Figs.  51-1  and  
Fig. 55-5).32

HeartMuscle
The  cellular  effects  of  ischemia  commence  within  seconds  of  the 
onset of hypoxia with the loss of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pro-
duction.  Myocardial  relaxation-contraction  is  compromised,  and 
irreversible cell injury begins within as early as 20 minutes. Necrosis 
is usually complete in 6 hours unless reperfusion occurs or an exten-
sive collateral circulation is present (Fig. 51-6).

Gross Pathologic Findings.  On gross inspection, MI falls into two 
major types: transmural infarcts, in which myocardial necrosis involves 
the full thickness (or almost full thickness) of the ventricular wall, and 
subendocardial (nontransmural) infarcts, in which the necrosis involves 
the  subendocardium,  the  intramural  myocardium,  or  both  without 
extending all the way through the ventricular wall to the epicardium 
(Fig. 51-7).

Occlusive  coronary  thrombosis  appears  to  be  far  more  common 
when the infarction is transmural and localized to the distribution of 
a  single  coronary  artery  (see  Fig.  51-5).  Nontransmural  infarctions, 
however, frequently occur in the presence of severely narrowed but 
still patent coronary arteries or when the infarcted region has suffi-
cient collateral circulation. Patchy nontransmural infarction may arise 
secondary  to  fibrinolysis  or  PCI  of  an  originally  occlusive  thrombus 
with restoration of blood flow before the wave front of necrosis has 
extended  from  the  subendocardium  across  the  full  thickness  of  the 
ventricular wall (see Fig. 51-3).

Histologic and Ultrastructural Findings.  Gross alterations in the 
myocardium  are  difficult  to  identify  until  at  least  6  to  12  hours  has 
elapsed  following  the  onset  of  necrosis  (Fig. 51-8),  but  a  variety  of 
histochemical stains can identify zones of necrosis after only 2 to 3 
hours  (Fig.  51-9).33  Subsequently,  the  infarcted  myocardium  under-
goes a sequence of gross pathologic changes (Fig. 51-10; see also Fig. 
51-8).34 Within hours of death from MI, the presence of an infarct can 
often be detected by immersing slices of myocardium in triphenyltet-
razolium chloride, which turns noninfarcted myocardium a brick red 
color while the infarcted area remains unstained (see Fig. 51-7).

Microscopic Findings.  Histologic evaluation of MI reveals various 
stages of the healing process (see Figs. 51-8 to 51-10). In experimental 
infarction,  the  earliest  ultrastructural  changes  in  cardiac  muscle  fol-
lowing ligation of a coronary artery, noted within 20 minutes, consist 
of a reduction in the size and number of glycogen granules; intracel-
lular  edema;  and  swelling  and  distortion  of  the  transverse  tubular 
system,  sarcoplasmic  reticulum,  and  mitochondria  (see  Fig.  51-8).35

location of the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA); the latter gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA) in most 
patients. The middle of the figure shows the location of the zones of necrosis following occlusion of a major epicardial coronary artery. Identification of the infarct artery 
from the 12-lead ECG is shown at the bottom. The 17 myocardial segments in a polar map format (A) are shown with superimposition of the arterial supply provided by 
the LAD artery (B), RCA (C), and LCX artery (D). E, Position of the standard ECG leads relative to the polar map. The infarct artery can be deduced by identifying the leads 
that show ST elevation and referencing that information to A to D. For example, ST elevation seen most prominently in the leads overlying segments 1, 2, 7, 8, 13, 14, 
and 17 indicates that the LAD is the infarct artery. D1 = first diagonal; OM = obtuse marginal; PB = posterobasal; PD = posterior descending; PL = posterolateral; S1 = first

extended collaterals. (From Traupe T, Gloekler S, de Marchi SF, et al: Assessment of the human coronary collateral circulation. Circulation 122:1210, 2010.)

Necrosis with Contraction Bands.  This form of myocardial necro-
sis, also termed contraction band necrosis or coagulative myocytolysis, 
results primarily from severe ischemia followed by reflow.34 It is char-
acterized  by  hypercontracted  myofibrils  with  contraction  bands  and 
mitochondrial damage, frequently with calcification, marked vascular 
congestion, and healing by lysis of muscle cells. Necrosis with contrac-
tion bands is caused by increased influx of Ca2+ into dying cells, which 
results in the arrest of cells in the contracted state in the periphery of 
large infarcts and, to a greater extent, in nontransmural than in trans-
mural infarcts. The entire infarct may show this form of necrosis after 
reperfusion (see Fig. 51-9).

Myocytolysis.  Ischemia without necrosis generally causes no acute 
changes  visible  on  light  microscopy,  but  severe  prolonged  ischemia 
can result in myocyte vacuolization, often termed myocytolysis. Pro-
longed severe ischemia, which is potentially reversible, causes cloudy 
swelling, as well as hydropic, vascular, and fatty degeneration.

Apoptosis.  An  additional  pathway  of  myocyte  death  involves 
apoptosis,  or  programmed  cell  death.  In  contrast  to  coagulation 
necrosis,  myocytes  undergoing  apoptosis  exhibit  shrinkage  of  cells, 
fragmentation of DNA, and phagocytosis but without the usual cel-
lular infiltrate indicative of inflammation.34 The role of apoptosis in the 
setting of MI is less well understood than that of classic coagulation 
necrosis.  Apoptosis  may  occur  shortly  after  the  onset  of  myocardial 
ischemia, but its major impact appears to be on late myocyte loss and 
ventricular remodeling after MI.36

Current Concepts of the Cellular Events During 
Myocardial Infarction and Healing
Classic  studies  defined  the  sequence  of  cellular  events  that  occur 
during  human  MI  by  careful  histologic  studies.37  Accumulation  of 
granulocytes characterized the first days following MI. After the first 
days, mononuclear phagocytes accumulated in the infarct in tissue. 
Finally,  granulation  tissue  characterized  by  neovascularization  and 
accumulation of extracellular matrix (fibrosis) followed. Recent exper-
imental  work  in  mice  has  revealed  a  sequence  of  accumulation  of 
subpopulations of mononuclear phagocytes.38 The first wave, occur-
ring about days 1 to 3 following coronary ligation, consists of a pro-
inflammatory subset of monocytes characterized by high proteolytic 
and  phagocytic  capacity  and  elaboration  of  proinflammatory  cyto-
kines. During a later phase (days 3 to 7), less inflammatory monocytes 
predominate  and  produce  the  angiogenic  mediator  vascular  endo-
thelial growth factor (VEGF) and the fibrogenic mediator transforming 
growth  factor-beta  (TGF-).  This  highly  orchestrated  sequential 
recruitment of subpopulations of monocytes probably plays an impor-
tant  role  in  myocardial  healing.  The  first  wave  of  proinflammatory 
and phagocytically active mononuclear cells constitutes a cleanup

FIGURE51-7  Top, Acute MI, predominantly of the posterolateral left ventricle, 
demonstrated histochemically by lack of staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride 
in areas of necrosis. The staining defect is caused by leakage of the enzyme fol-
lowing  cell  death.  The  myocardial  hemorrhage  at  one  edge  of  the  infarct  was 
associated with cardiac rupture, and the anterior scar (lower left) was indicative of 
an  old  infarct.  The  specimen  was  oriented  with  the  posterior  wall  at  the  top. 
Bottom, The early tissue response to the infarction process involves a mixture of 
bland  necrosis,  inflammation,  and  hemorrhage.  (From  Schoen  FJ:  The  heart.  In 
Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N [eds]: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease. 
8th ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 2009.)

These early changes are reversible. Changes after 60 minutes of occlu-
sion  include  myocyte  swelling,  swelling  and  internal  disruption  of 
mitochondria,  development  of  amorphous,  flocculent  aggregation 
and  margination  of  nuclear  chromatin,  and  relaxation  of  myofibrils. 
After  20  minutes  to  2  hours  of  ischemia,  the  changes  in  some  cells 
become irreversible and progression of these alterations occurs.34

Patterns of Myocardial Necrosis
Coagulation Necrosis.  Coagulation necrosis results from severe, 
persistent  ischemia  and  is  usually  present  in  the  central  region  of 
infarcts; it causes arrest of muscle cells in the relaxed state and passive 
stretching of ischemic muscle cells. The tissue exhibits stretched myo-
fibrils,  many  cells  with  pyknotic  nuclei,  congested  microvessels,  and 
phagocytosis  of  necrotic  muscle  cells  (see  Fig.  51-8).  Mitochondrial 
damage with prominent amorphous (flocculent) densities occurs, but 
no calcification is evident.

FIGURE51-8  Temporal sequence of early biochemical, ultrastructural, histochemical, and histologic findings after the onset of MI. Top, Schematics of the time frames for 
early and late reperfusion of the myocardium supplied by an occluded coronary artery. For approximately 30 minutes after the onset of even the most severe ischemia, myo-
cardial injury is potentially reversible; after this point, progressive loss of viability occurs and is complete by 6 to 12 hours. The benefits of reperfusion are greatest when it is 
achieved early, with progressively smaller benefits occurring as reperfusion is delayed. Note the alterations in the temporal sequence in the reperfused infarct. The pattern of 
pathologic findings following reperfusion varies depending on the timing of reperfusion, previous infarction, and collateral flow. TTC = triphenyltetrazolium chloride. (From

crew that clears necrotic debris and paves the way for the second 
wave  of  less  inflammatory  monocytes,  which  contribute  to  healing 
by promoting the formation of granulation tissue.

Modification of Pathologic Changes by Reperfusion
When  reperfusion  of  myocardium  undergoing  the  evolutionary 
changes  from  ischemia  to  infarction  occurs  sufficiently  early  (i.e., 

within  15  to  20  minutes),  it  can  successfully  prevent  necrosis  from 
developing.  Beyond  this  early  stage,  the  number  of  salvaged 
myocytesand  therefore  the  amount  of  salvaged  myocardial  tissue 
(area of necrosis/area at risk)is directly related to the length of time 
of  total  coronary  artery  occlusion,  the  level  of  myocardial  oxygen 
consumption,  and  collateral  blood  flow  (Fig.  51-11).  Reperfused 
infarcts typically show a mixture of necrosis, hemorrhage within zones

of irreversibly injured myocytes, coagulative necrosis with contraction 
bands, and distorted architecture of cells in the reperfused zone (Fig. 
51-12). Reperfusion of infarcted myocardium accelerates the washout 
of leaked intracellular proteins, thereby producing an exaggerated and 
early  peak  value  of  substances  such  as  the  MB  fraction  of  creatine 
kinase (CK-MB) and cardiac-specific troponin T and I (see below).39

Coronary Anatomy and Location of Infarction
Angiographic studies performed in the earliest hours of STEMI have 
revealed  an  approximately  90%  incidence  of  total  occlusion  of  the 
infarct-related  vessel.  Recanalization  as  a  result  of  spontaneous 
thrombolysis diminishes angiographic total occlusion in the period 
following the onset of MI. Pharmacologic fibrinolysis and PCI mark-
edly increase the proportion of patients with a patent infarct-related 
artery early after STEMI.

A  STEMI  with  transmural  necrosis  typically  occurs  distal  to  an 
acutely  totally  occluded  coronary  artery  with  thrombus  superim-
posed on a ruptured plaque (see Fig. 51-5). Yet chronic total occlusion 
of a coronary artery does not always cause MI. Collateral blood flow 
and  other  factors  such  as  the  level  of  myocardial  metabolism,  the 
presence and location of stenoses in other coronary arteries, the rate 

of development of the obstruction, and the quantity of myocardium 
supplied by the obstructed vessel all influence the viability of myo-
cardial cells distal to the occlusion. In many series of patients studied 
at  necropsy  or  by  coronary  arteriography,  a  small  number  (5%)  of 
those with STEMI have normal coronary vessels. An embolus that has 
lysed,  a  transiently  occlusive  platelet  aggregate,  or  a  prolonged 
episode  of  severe  coronary  spasm  may  cause  the  infarct  in  these 
patients.

Studies of patients in whom STEMI ultimately develops after having 
undergone coronary angiography at some time before its occurrence 
have helped clarify the coronary anatomy before infarction. Although 
high-grade  stenoses,  when  present,  more  frequently  lead  to  STEMI 
than do less severe lesions, most occlusions occur in vessels with a 
previously  identified  stenosis  of  less  than  50%  on  angiograms  per-
formed months to years earlier.27 This finding supports the concept 
that  STEMI  results  from  sudden  thrombotic  occlusion  at  the  site  of 
rupture of previously nonobstructive but lipid-rich plaque. When col-
lateral vessels perfuse an area of the ventricle, an infarct may occur 
at  a  distance  from  a  coronary  occlusion.  For  example,  following 
gradual obliteration of the lumen of the right coronary artery, collat-
eral vessels arising from the left anterior descending coronary artery

can keep the inferior wall of the left ventricle viable. Later, an occlu-
sion of the left anterior descending artery may cause infarction of the 
diaphragmatic wall.

Right Ventricular Infarction
Approximately  50%  of  patients  with  inferior  infarction  have  some 
involvement of the right ventricle.40 Among these patients, right ven-
tricular (RV) infarction occurs exclusively in those with transmural 
infarction of the inferoposterior wall and the posterior portion of the 
septum. RV infarction almost invariably develops in association with 
infarction  of  the  adjacent  septum  and  inferior  left  ventricular  (LV) 
walls, but isolated infarction of the right ventricle is seen in just 3% 

to 5% of autopsy-proven cases of MI. RV infarction occurs less com-
monly than would be anticipated from the frequency of atheroscle-
rotic  lesions  involving  the  right  coronary  artery.  The  right  ventricle 
can sustain long periods of ischemia but still demonstrate excellent 
recovery of contractile function after reperfusion.

Atrial Infarction
This type of infarction occurs in up to 10% of patients with STEMI if 
PR-segment displacement is used as the criterion. Although isolated 
atrial  infarction  is  observed  in  only  3.5%  of  patients  with  STEMI  at 
autopsy, it often occurs in conjunction with ventricular infarction and 
can cause rupture of the atrial wall.41 This type of infarction is more

FIGURE51-11  Consequences of reperfusion at various times after coronary adhesion. In this example the mid-
portion  of  the  left  anterior  descending  coronary  artery  is  occluded  and  a  large  zone  of  ischemic  myocardium 
developsthe area at risk. Reperfusion in less than 20 minutes does not result in permanent loss of tissue, but 
there may be a period of contractile dysfunction of the reperfused myocardiuma condition referred to as stun-
ning.  Later  reperfusion  results  in  hemorrhagic  necrosis  with  contraction  bands.  Permanent  occlusion  results  in 
necrosis  of  myocardium.  (From  Schoen  FJ:  The  heart.  In  Kumar  V,  Abbas  AK,  Fausto  N  [eds]:  Robbins  &  Cotran

common  on  the  right  side  than  on  the  left  side,  occurs  more  fre-
quently in the atrial appendages than in the lateral or posterior walls 
of the atrium, and can result in thrombus formation. Atrial infarction 
is frequently accompanied by atrial arrhythmias and has been linked 
to reduced secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide and to a lowcardiac 
output syndrome when RV infarction coexists.

Collateral Circulation in Acute Myocardial  
Infarction (See Chapter 49)
The coronary collateral circulation is particularly well developed in 
patients with coronary occlusive disease, especially with reduction 
of the luminal cross-sectional area by more than 75% in one or more 
major vessels; in patients with chronic hypoxia, as occurs in cases of 
severe anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cyanotic 
congenital  heart  disease;  and  in  patients  with  LV  hypertrophy  (see 
Fig. 51-6).42

The magnitude of coronary collateral flow is a principal determi-
nant of infarct size. Indeed, patients with abundant collateral vessels 
commonly have totally occluded coronary arteries without evidence 
of infarction in the distribution of that artery; thus survival of myo-
cardium  distal  to  such  occlusions  depends  largely  on  collateral  
blood  flow.  Even  if  the  collateral  perfusion  existing  at  the  time  of 
coronary  occlusion  does  not  prevent  infarction,  it  may  still  exert  a 
beneficial  effect  by  preventing  the  formation  of  LV  aneurysms.  
The presence of a high-grade stenosis (90%), possibly with periods 
of  intermittent  total  occlusion,  probably  permits  the  development  
of  collateral  vessels  that  remain  only  as  potential  conduits  until  a  
total  occlusion  occurs  or  recurs.  Total  occlusion  then  brings  these 
channels into full operation. Patients with angiographic evidence of 
collateral  formation  have  improved  angiographic  and  clinical  out-
comes after MI.

Nonatherosclerotic Causes of Acute  
Myocardial Infarction
Numerous  pathologic  processes  other  than  atherosclerosis  can 
involve  the  coronary  arteries  and  result  in  STEMI  (see  Table  51-3).

For  example,  coronary  arterial  occlu-
sions  can  result  from  embolization  of  
a  coronary  artery.  The  causes  of  coro-
nary  embolism  are  numerous:  infective  
endocarditis  and  nonbacterial  throm-
botic  endocarditis  (see  Chapter  64), 
mural  thrombi,  prosthetic  valves,  neo-
plasms,  air  introduced  at  the  time  of 
cardiac  surgery,  and  calcium  deposits 
from  manipulation  of  calcified  valves  at 
surgery.  In  situ  thrombosis  of  coronary 
arteries  can  occur  secondary  to  chest 
wall trauma (see Chapter 72).

A  variety  of  inflammatory  processes 
can cause coronary artery abnormalities, 
some  of  which  mimic  atherosclerotic 
disease and may predispose to true ath-
erosclerosis. Epidemiologic evidence sug-
gests  that  viral  infections,  particularly 
with Coxsackie B virus, may uncommonly 
cause  MI.  Viral  illnesses  occasionally 
precede MI in young persons who are later 
shown to have normal coronary arteries.
Syphilitic aortitis can produce marked 
narrowing  or  occlusion  of  one  or  both 
coronary  ostia,  whereas  Takayasu  arte-
ritis  can  result  in  obstruction  of  the  
coronary  arteries.  Necrotizing  arteri-
tis,  polyarteritis  nodosa,  mucocutane-
ous  lymph  node  syndrome  (Kawasaki 
disease),  systemic  lupus  erythematosus 
(see Chapter 84), and giant cell arteritis 
can cause coronary occlusion. Therapeu-
tic  levels  of  mediastinal  radiation  can 
result  in  coronary  arteriosclerosis43  with  subsequent  infarction.  MI 
can  also  result  from  coronary  arterial  involvement  in  patients  with 
amyloidosis (see Chapter  65), Hurler syndrome, pseudoxanthoma 
elasticum,  and  homocystinuria.  Cocaine  can  cause  MI  in  patients 
with normal coronary arteries, preexisting MI, documented coronary 
artery disease, or coronary artery spasm (see Chapter 68).

Myocardial Infarction with Angiographically  
Normal Coronary Vessels
Patients with STEMI and normal coronary arteries tend to be young 
with relatively few coronary risk factors except that they often have 
a  history  of  cigarette  smoking  (Table  51-4).  Usually,  they  have  no 
history of angina pectoris before the infarction. These patients do not 
generally have a prodrome before infarction, but the clinical, labora-
tory, and electrocardiographic features of STEMI otherwise resemble 
those present in the overwhelming majority of patients with STEMI 
who have classic obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.
Patients who recover frequently have areas of localized dyskinesis 
and  hypokinesis  identified  at  LV  angiography.  Many  of  these  cases 
result from coronary artery spasm and/or thrombosis, perhaps with 
underlying endothelial dysfunction or plaque not apparent on coro-
nary  angiography.  The  transient  LV  apical  ballooning  syndrome 
(takotsubo  cardiomyopathy)  is  characterized  by  transient  wall 
motion abnormalities involving the LV apex and midventricle (Fig. 
51-13). This syndrome occurs in the absence of obstructive epicardial 
coronary disease and can mimic STEMI.44,45 Typically, an episode of 
psychological stress precedes the development of takotsubo cardio-
myopathy.  Initial  ECGs  demonstrate  significant  and  often  diffuse 
ST-segment elevations that when coupled with the typical (frequently 
severe) chest discomfort, prompts the appropriate immediate referral 
for coronary angiography. The cause is not clear, but catecholamine-
mediated  myocardial  stunning  and  microvascular  dysfunction  play 
important roles.46

Additional suggested causes include (1) coronary emboli (perhaps 
from a small mural thrombus, a prolapsed mitral valve, or a myxoma);

The  long-term  outlook  for  patients  who

brighter  than  for  those  with  STEMI  and 
obstructive coronary artery disease.45 After 
recovery  from  the  initial  infarct,  recurrent 
infarction,  heart  failure,  and  death  are 
unusual  in  patients  with  normal  coronary

LeftVentricularFunction
Systolic Function
On interruption of antegrade flow in an epi-
cardial  coronary  artery,  the  zone  of  myo-
cardium supplied by that vessel immediately 
loses its ability to shorten and perform con-
tractile work (see Fig. 51-12). Four abnormal 
contraction patterns develop in sequence: 
(1)  dyssynchrony,  or  dissociation  of  the 
time  course  of  contraction  of  adjacent  
segments;  (2)  hypokinesis,  or  a  reduction 
in  the  extent  of  shortening;  (3)  akinesis,  
or cessation of shortening; and (4) dyskine-
sis,  paradoxical  expansion,  and  systolic 
bulging.  Hyperkinesis  of  the  remaining 
normal myocardium initially accompanies 
dysfunction of the infarct. The early hyper-
kinesis  of  the  noninfarcted  zones  prob-
ably  results  from  acute  compensation, 
including  increased activity of the sympa-
thetic  nervous  system  and  the  Frank-
Starling  mechanism.  A  portion  of  this 
compensatory  hyperkinesis  is  ineffective 
work  because  contraction  of  the  nonin-
farcted  segments  of  myocardium  causes 
dyskinesis of the infarct zone. The increased 
motion of the noninfarcted region subsides 
within 2 weeks of infarction, during which 
time some degree of recovery often occurs 
in the infarct region as well, particularly if 
reperfusion  of  the  infarcted  area  occurs 
and myocardial stunning diminishes.

The schematic diagram at the bottom depicts the timing of changes in function and viability. A key point is that 
although function drops dramatically after coronary occlusion, the tissue is still viable for a period. This is the basis 
for early aggressive efforts at reperfusion of patients with STEMI. (From Schoen FJ: The heart. In Kumar V, Abbas 
AK, Fausto N [eds]: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease. 8th ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 2009.)

on  coronary  arteriography  or  coronary  arterial  thrombosis  with  
subsequent  recanalization;  (3)  a  hematologic  disorder  (polycythe-
mia  vera,  cyanotic  heart  disease  with  polycythemia,  sickle  cell 
anemia,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  thrombocytosis, 
and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) causing in situ thrombo-
sis  in  the  presence  of  normal  coronary  arteries;  (4)  augmented 
oxygen  demand  (e.g.,  thyrotoxicosis,  amphetamine  use);  (5)  hypo-
tension  secondary  to  sepsis,  blood  loss,  or  pharmacologic  agents; 
and (6) anatomic variations such as anomalous origin of a coronary 
artery (see Chapter 20), coronary arteriovenous fistula, or a myocar-
dial bridge.

Days

Patients  with  STEMI  also  often  have 
reduced myocardial contractile function in 
noninfarcted zones. This finding may result 
from previous obstruction of the coronary 
artery supplying the noninfarcted region of 
the ventricle and loss of collaterals from the 
freshly  occluded  infarct-related  vessel,  a 
condition  termed  ischemia  at  a  distance. 
Conversely, the development of collaterals 
before  STEMI  occurs  may  allow  greater 
preservation of regional systolic function in an area of distribution of 
the  occluded  artery  and  improvement  in  the  LV  ejection  fraction 
early after infarction (see Fig. 51-6).42

If a sufficient quantity of myocardium undergoes ischemic injury 
(see Fig. 51-12), LV pump function becomes depressed; cardiac output, 
stroke  volume,  blood  pressure,  and  peak  dP/dt  decline;  and  end-
systolic volume increases. The degree to which end-systolic volume 
increases  is  perhaps  the  most  powerful  hemodynamic  predictor  of 
mortality following STEMI.47 Paradoxical systolic expansion of an area 
of ventricular myocardium further decreases LV stroke volume.48 As 
necrotic  myocytes  slip  past  each  other,  the  infarct  zone  thins  and 
elongates, especially in patients with large anterior infarcts, thereby

infarction. J Am Coll Cardiol 60:1581, 2012.

leading to expansion of the infarct. In some patients a vicious circle 
of dilation begetting further dilation ensues. The degree of ventricular 
dilation, which depends closely on infarct size, patency of the infarct-
related  artery,  and  activation  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system (RAAS), can be favorably modified by inhibitors of this system, 
even in the absence of symptomatic LV dysfunction.49,50

With time, edema and ultimately fibrosis increase the stiffness of the 
infarcted myocardium back to and beyond control values. Increasing 
stiffness  in  the  infarcted  zone  of  myocardium  improves  LV  function 
because it prevents paradoxical systolic wall motion (dyskinesia).

The  likelihood  of  clinical  symptoms  developing  correlates  with 
specific parameters of LV function. The earliest abnormality is ven-
tricular stiffness in diastole (see later), which is observed with infarcts 
involving  only  a  small  portion  of  the  left  ventricle  on  angiographic 
examination.  When  the  abnormally  contracting  segment  exceeds 
15%, the ejection fraction may decline and LV end-diastolic pressure 
and volume increase. Risk for the development of physical signs and 
symptoms  of  LV  failure  also  increases  in  proportion  to  increasing 
areas of abnormal LV wall motion. Clinical heart failure accompanies 
areas  of  abnormal  contraction  exceeding  25%,  and  cardiogenic 
shock, often fatal, is associated with loss of more than 40% of the LV 
myocardium.

Unless  extension  of  the  infarct  occurs,  some  improvement  in  wall 
motion takes place during the healing phase, with recovery of function 
occurring  in  initially  reversibly  injured  (stunned)  myocardium  (see 
Figs. 51-11 and 51-12). Regardless of the age of the infarct, patients who 
continue to demonstrate abnormal wall motion involving 20% to 25% 
of the left ventricle will probably manifest hemodynamic signs of LV 
failure, with its attendant poor prognosis for long-term survival.

Diastolic Function
The diastolic properties of the left ventricle (see Chapters  21,  22, 
and  27)  change  in  infarcted  and  ischemic  myocardium.  These 

1081

alterations are associated with a decrease in the peak rate of decline 
in LV pressure (peakdP/dt), an increase in the time constant of the 
fall  in  LV  pressure,  and  an  initial  rise  in  LV  end-diastolic  pressure. 
Over a period of several weeks, end-diastolic volume increases and 
diastolic pressure begins to fall toward normal. As with impairment 
of  systolic  function,  the  magnitude  of  the  diastolic  abnormality 
appears to be related to the size of the infarct.

Circulatory Regulation
Patients  with  STEMI  have  an  abnormality  in  circulatory  regulation. 
The process begins with an anatomic or functional obstruction in the 
coronary vascular bed that results in regional myocardial ischemia 
and, if the ischemia persists, in infarction (Fig. 51-14). If the infarct 
is of sufficient size, it depresses overall LV function such that LV stroke 
volume  falls  and  filling  pressure  rises.51  A  marked  depression  in 
LV  stroke  volume  ultimately  lowers  aortic  pressure  and  reduces  
coronary perfusion pressure; this condition may intensify myocardial 
ischemia and thereby initiate a vicious circle (Fig. 51-14) leading to 
cardiogenic  shock,  which  occurs  in  5%  to  8%  of  patients  with 
STEMI.52,53  Systemic  inflammation  secondary  to  myocardial  injury 
leads to the release of cytokines that contribute to the vasodilation 
and  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance.52  The  inability  of  the 
left  ventricle  to  empty  normally  also  increases  preload;  that  is,  it 
dilates  the  well-perfused,  normally  functioning  portion  of  the  left 
ventricle.  This  compensatory  mechanism  tends  to  restore  stroke 
volume  to  normal  levels,  but  at  the  expense  of  a  reduced  ejection 
fraction. Dilation of the left ventricle also elevates ventricular after-
load,  however,  because  Laplaces  law  dictates  that  at  any  given  
arterial  pressure,  the  dilated  ventricle  must  develop  higher  wall 
tension. This increased afterload not only depresses LV stroke volume 
but  also  elevates  myocardial  oxygen  consumption,  which  in  turn 
intensifies the myocardial ischemia. When regional myocardial dys-
function is limited and the function of the remainder of the left ven-
tricle is normal, compensatory mechanismsespecially hyperkinesis 
of the nonaffected portion of the ventriclesustain overall LV func-
tion. If a large portion of the left ventricle ceases to function, pump 
failure occurs.

VentricularRemodeling(SeealsoChapter22)
As a consequence of STEMI, the changes in LV size, shape, and thick-
ness involving both the infarcted and noninfarcted segments of the 
ventricle described earlier occur and are collectively referred to as 
ventricular remodelingwhich in turn can influence ventricular func-
tion  and  prognosis.54  Changes  in  LV  dilation  combined  with  hyper-
trophy of residual noninfarcted myocardium cause remodeling. After 
infarct size, other important factors driving the process of LV dilation 
are  ventricular  volume,  loading  conditions,  and  infarct  artery 
patency.48,55  Elevated  ventricular  pressure  contributes  to  increased 
wall  stress  and  the  risk  for  infarct  expansion,  but  a  patent  infarct 
artery  accelerates  myocardial  scar  formation  and  increases  tissue 
turgor in the infarct zone, thereby reducing the risk for infarct expan-
sion and ventricular dilation.

Infarct Expansion
An  increase  in  the  size  of  the  infarcted  segment,  known  as  infarct 
expansion, is defined as acute dilation and thinning of the area of 
infarction not explained by additional myocardial necrosis. Infarct 
expansion appears to result from a combination of slippage between 
muscle bundles, which reduces the number of myocytes across the 
infarct wall; disruption of normal myocardial cells; and destruction 
of extracellular matrix within the necrotic zone.56 Infarct expansion 
involves thinning and dilation of the infarct zone before the formation 
of a firm, fibrotic scar. The degree of infarct expansion appears to be 
related  to  preinfarction  wall  thickness,  with  existing  hypertrophy 
possibly  protecting  against  infarct  thinning.  On  a  cellular  level,  the 
degree  of  expansion  and  worsening  remodeling  depends  on  the 
intensity of the inflammatory response to the necrotic cells. Suppres-
sion of cytokine expression and stimulation may minimize the degree 
of inflammation and thus final infarct size.56 The apex, the thinnest

FIGURE 51-13  A  proposed  mechanism  for  takotsubo,  or  stress-mediated,  cardiomyopathy  begins  with  sudden  and  severe  emotional  stress,  which  activates  central 
autonomic network neurons expressing estrogen receptors. Simultaneously, sympathetic neuronal and adrenomedullary hormonal outflow increases dramatically and results 
in release of epinephrine (Epi) from the adrenal medulla combined with the release of norepinephrine (NE) from cardiac and extracardiac sympathetic nerves, which stimulate 
adrenoceptors in the blood vessels of the heart. Contraction of resistance vessels rapidly increases systemic blood pressure and cardiac afterload. High circulating levels of 
NE and Epi can precipitate catecholamine toxicity in cardiomyocytes via occupation of adrenoceptors. The typical hypercontraction of the basal sections of the heart, which 
leads to functional basal obstruction of LV outflow, further exacerbates LV wall stress and increases end-diastolic pressure. ANP = atrial natriuretic peptide; HSP70 = heat 
shock protein 70; NO = nitric oxide. (From Akashi YJ, Goldstein DS, Barbaro G, Ueyama T: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: A new form of acute, reversible heart failure. Circula-
tion 118:2754, 2008.)

region of the left ventricle, is particularly vulnerable to infarct expan-
sion. Infarction of the apex secondary to occlusion of the left anterior 
descending  coronary  artery  causes  the  radius  of  curvature  at  the 
apex  to  increase,  thereby  exposing  this  normally  thin  region  to  a 
marked elevation in wall stress.

Infarct  expansion  is  associated  with  both  higher  mortality  and  a 
higher  incidence  of  nonfatal  complications,  such  as  heart  failure  
and  ventricular  aneurysm.  Infarct  expansion  is  best  recognized  as 
elongation of the noncontractile region of the ventricle on echocar-
diography or CMR. When the expansion is severe enough to cause 
symptoms, the most characteristic clinical findings are deterioration 
of  systolic  function,  new  or  worsening  pulmonary  congestion,  and 
the development of ventricular arrhythmias.

Ventricular Dilation
Although infarct expansion plays an important role in the ventricular 
remodeling that occurs early following MI, remodeling is also caused 
by dilation of the viable portion of the ventricle, which commences 
immediately after STEMI and progresses for months or years thereaf-
ter.  A  shift  of  the  pressure-volume  curve  of  the  left  ventricle  to  the 
right, which results in a larger LV volume at any given diastolic pres-
sure, may accompany dilation. This dilation of the noninfarcted zone 
can  be  viewed  as  a  compensatory  mechanism  that  maintains  
stroke volume in the presence of a large infarction. STEMI places an 

extra  load  on  the  residual  functioning  myocardium,  a  burden  that  
presumably  causes  the  compensatory  hypertrophy  of  the  nonin-
farcted  myocardium.  This  hypertrophy  could  help  compensate  for 
the functional impairment caused by the infarct and may be respon-
sible  for  some  of  the  hemodynamic  improvement  seen  in  some 
patients in the months after infarction.

Effects of Treatment
Several factors can affect ventricular remodeling after STEMI, notably 
infarct  size  (see  Figs.  51-11  and  51-12).  Acute  reperfusion  and  other 
measures  to  restrict  the  extent  of  myocardial  necrosis  limit  the 
increase in ventricular volume after STEMI. Multiple pharmacologic 
agents  aimed  at  limiting  infarct  size  have  undergone  evaluation  in 
clinical trials, although few have produced significant results in ade-
quately  powered  phase  III  investigations  (see  Chapter  52).  The 
second  factor  is  scar  formation  in  the  infarct.  Glucocorticosteroids 
and  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  given  early  after  MI  can 
cause  scar  thinning  and  greater  infarct  expansion,  whereas  RAAS 
inhibitors attenuate the ventricular enlargement.49 Additional benefi-
cial consequences of inhibition of angiotensin II that may contribute 
to myocardial protection include attenuation of endothelial dysfunc-
tion  and  direct  antiatherogenic  effects.  Inhibition  of  aldosterone 
action may limit excessive fibrosis and decrease the development of 
ventricular arrhythmias.57

FIGURE51-14  Current concept of the pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock. Myocardial injury causes systolic and diastolic dysfunction. A decrease in cardiac output 
leads to a decrease in systemic and coronary perfusion. The decreased perfusion exacerbates ischemia and causes cell death in the infarct border zone and the remote 
zone  of  myocardium.  Inadequate  systemic  perfusion  triggers  reflex  vasoconstriction,  which  is  usually  insufficient.  Systemic  inflammation  may  play  a  role  in  limiting  the 
peripheral  vascular  compensatory  response  and  may  contribute  to  the  myocardial  dysfunction.  Whether  inflammation  plays  a  causal  role  or  is  only  an  epiphenomenon 
remains unclear. Revascularization leads to relief of ischemia. Demonstration of an increase in cardiac output or the LV ejection fraction as the mechanism of benefit of 
revascularization  has  not  been  possible,  but  revascularization  significantly  increases  the  likelihood  of  survival  with  good  quality  of  life.  IL-6 =  interleukin-6;  LVEDP =  LV 
end-diastolic pressure; NO = nitric oxide; TNF- = tumor necrosis factor-alpha. (From Reynolds HR, Hochman JS: Cardiogenic shock: Current concepts and improving out-
comes. Circulation 117:686, 2008.)

PathophysiologyofOtherOrganSystems
Pulmonary Function
Arterial oxygen tension is inversely related to pulmonary artery dia-
stolic  pressure,  which  suggests  that  if  patients  with  STEMI  become 
hypoxic, the increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure can 
promote interstitial edema and consequently result in arteriolar and 
bronchiolar compression that ultimately causes perfusion of poorly 
ventilated  alveoli  with  resultant  hypoxemia  (see  Chapter  22).  In 
addition  to  hypoxemia,  diffusion  capacity  decreases.  Hyperventila-
tion often occurs in patients with STEMI and may cause hypocapnia 
and  respiratory  alkalosis,  particularly  in  restless,  anxious  patients 
with  pain.  Pulmonary  extravascular  (interstitial)  water  content,  LV 
filling pressure, and the clinical signs and symptoms of LV failure are 
correlated.  The  increase  in  pulmonary  extravascular  water  may 
cause the alterations in pulmonary mechanics observed in patients 
with STEMI (i.e., reduction in airway conductance, pulmonary com-
pliance, forced expiratory volume, and midexpiratory flow rate and 
an increase in closing volume, presumably related to the widespread 
closure  of  small,  dependent  airways  during  the  first  3  days  after 
STEMI). Ultimately, severe increases in extravascular water may lead 
to  pulmonary  edema.  Virtually  all  lung  volume  indicestotal  lung 
capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume, as well 
as vital capacityfall during STEMI.

Reduction of the Affinity of Hemoglobin for Oxygen
In  patients  with  MI,  particularly  when  complicated  by  LV  failure  or 
cardiogenic  shock,  the  affinity  of  hemoglobin  for  oxygen  falls  (i.e., 
P50 increases). The increase in P50 results from increased levels of 

erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which is an important compen-
satory mechanism that is responsible for an estimated 18% increase 
in  release  of  oxygen  from  oxyhemoglobin  in  patients  with  cardio-
genic shock.

Endocrine Function
Pancreas.  Although patients with STEMI often have absolute con-
centrations  of  blood  insulin  in  the  normal  range,  these  levels  are 
usually  inappropriately  low  for  their  blood  sugar  concentration,  and 
relative insulin resistance may be present as well. Patients with cardio-
genic  shock  frequently  have  marked  hyperglycemia  with  depressed 
levels of circulating insulin. Abnormalities in insulin secretion and the 
resultant impaired glucose tolerance appear to be due to a reduction 
in pancreatic blood flow as a consequence of the splanchnic vasocon-
striction accompanying severe LV failure. In addition, increased activity 
of the sympathetic nervous system with augmented circulating cate-
cholamines  inhibits  insulin  secretion  and  increases  glycogenolysis, 
which also contributes to elevated blood sugar.58

Glucose permits the generation of ATP by anaerobic glycolysis, as 
opposed  to  free  fatty  acids,  which  require  aerobic  conditions  to 
furnish  ATP.59  Because  hypoxic  heart  muscle  derives  a  considerable 
proportion of its energy from the metabolism of glucose (see Chapter 
21) and because glucose uptake by the myocardium requires insulin, 
insulin deficiency can jeopardize the availability of energy. These meta-
bolic considerations, combined with epidemiologic observations that 
patients  with  diabetes  have  a  markedly  worse  prognosis,  served  as 
the  foundation  for  efforts  to  administer  insulin-glucose  infusions  to 
diabetic patients with STEMI. To date, however, none of these studies 
has demonstrated clear benefit (see Chapter 52).60,61

Adrenal Medulla.  Plasma and urinary catecholamine levels peak 
during  the  first  24  hours  after  the  onset  of  chest  pain,  with  the

greatest rise in plasma catecholamine secretion occurring during the 
first  hour  after  the  onset  of  STEMI.  These  high  levels  of  circulating 
catecholamines in patients with STEMI correlate with the occurrence 
of serious arrhythmias and result in an increase in myocardial oxygen 
consumption,  both  directly  and  indirectly,  as  a  consequence  of 
catecholamine-induced  elevation  of  circulating  free  fatty  acids.  The 
concentration of circulating catecholamines correlates with the extent 
of myocardial damage and the incidence of cardiogenic shock, as well 
as with both early and late mortality rates.

Circulating catecholamines enhance platelet aggregation; when this 
occurs  in  the  coronary  microcirculation,  release  of  the  potent  local 
vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 may further impair cardiac perfusion. 
The  marked  increase  in  sympathetic  activity  associated  with  STEMI 
serves as the foundation for beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (beta-
blocking agent) regimens in the acute phase.

Activation  of  the  Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone  System. 
Noninfarcted regions of the myocardium appear to exhibit activation 
of the tissue RAAS with increased production of angiotensin II. Both 
locally  and  systemically  generated  angiotensin  II  can  stimulate  the 
production of various growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth 
factor  and  TGF-,  that  promote  compensatory  hypertrophy  in  the 
noninfarcted myocardium, as well as control the structure and tone 
of  the  infarct-related  coronary  and  other  myocardial  vessels.  Addi-
tional  potential  actions  of  angiotensin  II  that  have  a  more  negative 
impact  on  the  infarction  process  include  the  release  of  endothelin, 
PAI-1, and aldosterone, which may cause vasoconstriction, impaired 
fibrinolysis, and increased sodium retention, respectively.

Natriuretic Peptides.  The peptides atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) 
and N-terminal pro-ANF are released from the cardiac atria in response 
to an elevation in atrial pressure. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and 
its precursor N-terminal pro-BNP are secreted by atrial and ventricular 
myocardium. Given the larger mass of ventricular than atrial myocar-
dium, the total amount of mRNA for BNP is higher in the ventricles 
than in the atria. Natriuretic peptides are released early after STEMI, 
with  a  peak  at  approximately  16  hours.  Evidence  shows  that  the 
natriuretic  peptides  released  from  the  left  ventricle  during  STEMI 
originate both from the infarcted myocardium and from viable non-
infarcted myocardium. The rise in BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP after 
STEMI correlates with infarct size and regional wall motion abnormali-
ties. Measurement of natriuretic peptides can provide useful informa-
tion both early and late in the course of STEMI.62,63

Adrenal Cortex.  Plasma and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and 
ketosteroids,  as  well  as  aldosterone,  rise  markedly  in  patients  with 
STEMI.  Their  concentrations  correlate  directly  with  the  peak  level  of 
serum CK, thus implying an association between the stress imposed by 
larger infarcts and greater secretion of adrenal steroids. The magnitude 
of  the  elevation  in  cortisol  correlates  with  infarct  size  and  mortality. 
Glucocorticosteroids also contribute to impaired glucose tolerance.

Thyroid Gland.  Although patients with STEMI are generally euthy-
roid  clinically,  serum  triiodothyronine  (T3)  levels  can  decrease  tran-
siently, a fall that is most marked on approximately the third day after 
the infarct. A rise in reverse T3 usually accompanies this fall in T3, with 
variable changes or no change in thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating 
hormone levels. The alteration in peripheral T4 metabolism appears to 
correlate with infarct size and may be mediated by the rise in endog-
enous levels of cortisol that accompanies STEMI.

Renal  Function.  Both  prerenal  azotemia  and  acute  renal  failure 
can complicate the marked reduction in cardiac output that occurs in 
cardiogenic shock. On the other hand, an increase in circulating atrial 
natriuretic  peptide  occurs  following  STEMI  and  correlates  with  the 
severity  of  LV  failure.  An  increase  in  natriuretic  peptide  also  occurs 
when RV infarction accompanies inferior wall infarction, thus suggest-
ing that this hormone may contribute to the hypotension that accom-
panies RV infarction.

Hematologic Alterations
Platelets.  STEMI generally occurs in the presence of extensive coro-
nary and systemic atherosclerotic plaque, which may serve as the site for 
the formation of platelet aggregatesa sequence suggested as the initial 
step  in  the  process  of  coronary  thrombosis,  coronary  occlusion,  and 
subsequent  MI.  Platelets  from  patients  with  STEMI  have  an  increased 
propensity for aggregation both systemically and locally in the area of 
disrupted plaque, and they release vasoactive substances.64

Hemostatic Markers.  Elevated levels of serum fibrinogen degra-
dation products, an end product of thrombosis, as well as release of 
distinctive proteins when platelets are activated (such as platelet factor 
4  and  beta-thromboglobulin),  occur  in  some  patients  with  STEMI. 
Fibrinopeptide A (FPA), a protein released from fibrin by thrombin, is 
a marker of ongoing thrombosis and increases during the early hours 

of STEMI. Marked elevation of hemostatic markers such as FPA, TAT, 
and F1.2 is associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients 
with STEMI. Interpretation of coagulation test results in patients with 
STEMI may be complicated by elevated blood levels of catecholamines, 
concomitant  shock,  and/or  pulmonary  embolismconditions  that 
may alter various tests of platelet and coagulation function. Additional 
factors  that  affect  coagulation  test  results  in  patients  with  STEMI 
include the type and dosage of antithrombotic agent and reperfusion 
of the infarct artery.

Leukocytes.  Leukocytosis  usually  accompanies  STEMI  in  propor-
tion to the magnitude of the necrotic process, elevated glucocorticoid 
levels, and possibly inflammation in the coronary arteries. The mag-
nitude of the elevation in leukocyte count is associated with in-hospital 
mortality  after  STEMI.65  Experimental  evidence  suggests  that  the 
surge in catecholamines after coronary occlusion can mobilize leuko-
cyte  progenitors  from  bone  marrow,  thereby  sustaining  the  inflam-
matory response following infarction.66

Blood  Viscosity.  Clinical  and  epidemiologic  studies  suggest  that 
several hemostatic and hemorheologic factors (e.g., fibrinogen, factor 
VII,  plasma  viscosity,  hematocrit,  red  blood  cell  aggregation,  total 
white blood cell count) participate in the pathophysiology of athero-
sclerosis  and  play  an  integral  role  in  acute  thrombotic  events.  An 
increase in blood viscosity also occurs in patients with STEMI and can 
be attributed to hemoconcentration during the first few days and later 
to  elevated  serum  concentrations  of  alpha2-globulin  and  fibrinogen, 
components of the acute-phase response to tissue necrosis that also 
cause the elevated sedimentation rate characteristic of STEMI.

CLINICALFEATURES

PredisposingFactors
Up to half of patients with STEMI have an identifiable precipitating 
factor  or  prodromal  symptoms.  Unusually  heavy  exercise  (particu-
larly in fatigued or habitually inactive patients) and emotional stress 
can  precipitate  STEMI.67  Such  infarctions  could  result  from  marked 
increases  in  myocardial  oxygen  consumption  in  the  presence  of 
severe coronary arterial narrowing.

Accelerating  angina  and  rest  angina,  two  patterns  of  unstable 
angina, may culminate in STEMI (see Fig. 51-1). Noncardiac surgical 
procedures may also precede STEMI. Perioperative risk stratification 
and preventive measures may limit STEMI and cardiac-related mortal-
ity (see Chapter 80).68 Reduced myocardial perfusion secondary to 
hypotension  (e.g.,  hemorrhagic  or  septic  shock)  and  the  increased 
myocardial oxygen demands caused by aortic stenosis, fever, tachy-
cardia,  and  agitation  can  also  contribute  to  myocardial  necrosis. 
Other  factors  reported  to  predispose  to  STEMI  include  respiratory 
infections, hypoxemia from any cause, pulmonary embolism, hypo-
glycemia, administration of ergot preparations, cocaine use, sympa-
thomimetics,  serum  sickness,  allergy,  and  rarely,  wasp  stings.  In 
patients  with  Prinzmetal  angina  (see  Chapter  54),  STEMI  may 
develop in the territory of the coronary artery that repeatedly under-
goes spasm.

Circadian Periodicity
The time of onset of STEMI has a pronounced circadian periodicity, 
with the peak incidence of events occurring in the morning.28 Circa-
dian rhythms affect many physiologic and biochemical variables; the 
early  morning  hours  are  associated  with  increases  in  plasma  cate-
cholamines  and  cortisol  and  in  platelet  aggregability.  Interestingly, 
the  characteristic  circadian  peak  is  absent  in  patients  receiving  a 
beta-blocking agent or aspirin before the development of STEMI. The 
concept of triggering a STEMI is complex and probably involves the 
superimposition of multiple factors such as the time of day, season, 
and the stress of natural disasters.69

characterizes the prodrome, but it occurs at rest or with less activity 
than  usual.  Yet  the  symptoms  are  often  not  disturbing  enough  to 
induce patients to seek immediate medical attention, and if they do, 
they may not be hospitalized. A feeling of general malaise or frank 
exhaustion  frequently  accompanies  other  symptoms  preceding 
STEMI.

Nature of the Pain
Pain in patients with STEMI varies in intensity; in most patients it is 
severe and in some instances is intolerable. The pain is prolongedit 
generally  lasts  for  more  than  30  minutes  and  frequently  for  several 
hours. The patient usually describes the discomfort as constricting, 
crushing, oppressing, or compressing and often complains of a sensa-
tion of a heavy weight or a squeezing in the chest. Although patients 
typically  describe  the  discomfort  as  a  choking,  viselike,  or  heavy 
pain, it can also be characterized as a stabbing, knifelike, boring, or 
burning  discomfort.  The  discomfort  usually  localizes  retrosternally 
and frequently spreads to both sides of the anterior part of the chest, 
with a predilection for the left side. Often the pain radiates down the 
ulnar aspect of the left arm and produces a tingling sensation in the 
left wrist, hand, and fingers. Some patients note only a dull ache or 
numbness of the wrists in association with severe substernal or pre-
cordial discomfort. In some patients, pain from STEMI may begin in 
the epigastrium and simulate a variety of abdominal disorders, which 
often  causes  STEMI  to  be  misdiagnosed  as  indigestion.  In  other 
patients  the  discomfort  of  STEMI  radiates  to  the  shoulders,  upper 
extremities, neck, jaw, and interscapular region, again usually favor-
ing the left side. In patients with preexisting angina pectoris, the pain 
of infarction generally resembles that of angina with respect to loca-
tion,  but  it  is  normally  much  more  severe,  lasts  longer,  and  is  not 
relieved by rest and nitroglycerin.

STEMI pain may subside by the time that the physician first encoun-
ters the patient (or the patient reaches the hospital), or it may persist 
for  many  hours.  Opiates,  particularly  morphine,  usually  relieve  the 
pain  (see  Chapter  52).  Both  angina  pectoris  and  STEMI  pain  are 
thought to arise from nerve endings in ischemic or injured, but not 
necrotic myocardium. Thus in cases of STEMI, stimulation of nerve 
fibers in an ischemic zone of myocardium surrounding the necrotic 
central area of infarction probably gives rise to the pain.

The pain often disappears suddenly and completely following res-
toration  of  blood  flow  to  the  infarct  territory.  In  patients  in  whom 
reocclusion occurs after fibrinolysis, pain recurs if the initial reperfu-
sion  has  left  viable  myocardium.  Thus  what  has  previously  been 
thought  of  as  the  pain  of  infarction,  sometimes  lasting  for  many 
hours,  probably  represents  pain  caused  by  ongoing  ischemia.  The 
recognition that pain implies ischemia and not infarction heightens 
the importance of seeking ways to relieve the ischemia, for which the 
pain is a marker. This finding suggests that clinicians should not be 
complacent  about  ongoing  cardiac  pain  in  any  circumstances.  In 
some patientsparticularly older adults, patients with diabetes, and 
heart transplantation recipientsSTEMI is manifested clinically not 
by chest pain but rather by symptoms of acute LV failure and chest 
tightness  or  by  marked  weakness  or  frank  syncope.  Diaphoresis, 
nausea, and vomiting may accompany these symptoms.

Other Symptoms
Nausea and vomiting may occur, presumably because of activation 
of the vagal reflex or stimulation of LV receptors as part of the Bezold-
Jarisch  reflex.  These  symptoms  occur  more  commonly  in  patients 
with  inferior  STEMI  than  in  those  with  anterior  STEMI.  Moreover, 
nausea and vomiting are common side effects of opiates. When the 
pain of STEMI is epigastric in location and associated with nausea 
and vomiting, the clinical picture can easily be confused with that of 
acute cholecystitis, gastritis, or peptic ulcer. Occasionally, a patient 
complains of diarrhea or a violent urge to defecate during the acute 
phase of STEMI. Other symptoms include feelings of profound weak-
ness,  dizziness,  palpitations,  cold  perspiration,  and  a  sense  of 
impending doom. On occasion, symptoms arising from an episode 
of cerebral embolism or other systemic arterial embolism can herald 
STEMI. Chest discomfort may not accompany these symptoms.

1085

Differential Diagnosis
STEMI pain may simulate that of acute pericarditis (see Chapter 71), 
which is usually associated with some pleuritic featuresit is aggra-
vated by respiratory movements and coughing and often involves the 
shoulder, ridge of the trapezius, and neck. An important feature that 
distinguishes pericardial pain from ischemic discomfort is that isch-
emic discomfort does not radiate to the trapezius ridge, a character-
istic  site  of  radiation  of  pericardial  pain.  Pleural  pain  is  generally 
sharp, knifelike, and aggravated in a cyclical fashion by each breath, 
which  distinguishes  it  from  the  deep,  dull,  steady  pain  of  STEMI. 
Pulmonary embolism (see Chapter 73) typically produces pain lat-
erally in the chest, is often pleuritic in nature, and may be associated 
with  hemoptysis.  The  pain  caused  by  acute  aortic  dissection  (see 
Chapter  57)  is  usually  localized  to  the  center  of  the  chest,  is 
extremely  severe  and  described  by  the  patient  as  a  ripping  or 
tearing  sensation,  is  at  its  maximal  intensity  shortly  after  onset, 
persists for many hours, and frequently radiates to the back or lower 
extremities. Often, one or more major arterial pulses are absent. Pain 
arising from the costochondral and chondrosternal articulations may 
be  associated  with  localized  swelling  and  redness;  it  is  generally 
sharp and darting and is characterized by marked localized tender-
ness.  Episodes  of  retrosternal  discomfort  induced  by  peristalsis  in 
patients  with  increased  esophageal  stiffness  and  episodes  of  sus-
tained esophageal contraction can mimic the pain of STEMI.

Silent ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction with  
Atypical Features
Nonfatal  STEMI  can  go  unrecognized  by  the  patient  and  be  mani-
fested only on subsequent routine electrocardiographic or postmor-
tem examinations. Of these unrecognized infarctions, approximately 
half  are  truly  silent,  with  patients  unable  to  recall  any  symptoms 
whatsoever. The other half of patients with so-called silent infarction 
can  recall  an  event  characterized  by  symptoms  compatible  with 
acute infarction when leading questions are posed after the electro-
cardiographic abnormalities are discovered. Unrecognized or silent 
infarction  occurs  more  commonly  in  patients  without  antecedent 
angina pectoris and in patients with diabetes and hypertension and 
are  typically  detected  by  identification  of  new  wall  motion  abnor-
malities,  fixed  perfusion  defects,  or  pathologic  Q  waves.70  Silent 
STEMI  is  often  followed  by  silent  ischemia  (see  Chapter  54).  The 
prognosis of patients with silent and symptomatic manifestations of 
STEMI appears to be quite similar.71,72

Atypical features of STEMI include the following: (1) heart failure 
(i.e., dyspnea without pain beginning de novo or worsening of estab-
lished failure), (2) classic angina pectoris without a particularly severe 
or prolonged episode, (3) atypical location of the pain, (4) central 
nervous system manifestations resembling those of stroke secondary 
to  a  sharp  reduction  in  cardiac  output  in  a  patient  with  cerebral 
arteriosclerosis, (5) apprehension and nervousness, (6) sudden mania 
or  psychosis,  (7)  syncope,  (8)  overwhelming  weakness,  (9)  acute 
indigestion, and (10) peripheral embolization. Women are seen more 
frequently than men with atypical features, and hence a high index 
of suspicion is required by the clinician (see Chapter 77).

PhysicalExamination(SeealsoChapter11)
General Appearance
Patients suffering from STEMI often appear anxious and in consider-
able  distress.  An  anguished  facial  expression  is  common,  andin 
contrast to patients with severe angina pectoris, who often lie, sit, or 
stand  still  because  all  forms  of  activity  increase  the  discomfort
some patients suffering from STEMI may be restless and move about 
in  an  effort  to  find  a  comfortable  position.  They  often  massage  or 
clutch their chests and frequently describe their pain with a clenched 
fist held against the sternum (the Levine sign, named after Dr. Samuel 
A.  Levine).  In  patients  with  LV  failure  and  sympathetic  stimulation, 
cold perspiration and skin pallor may be evident; they typically sit or 
are  propped  up  in  bed  and  gasp  for  breath.  Between  breaths  they 
may complain of chest discomfort or a feeling of suffocation. Cough 
producing frothy, pink, or blood-streaked sputum may occur.

Patients  in  cardiogenic  shock  often  lie  listlessly  and  make  few 
spontaneous  movements.  Their  skin  is  cool  and  clammy,  with  a 
bluish  or  mottled  color  over  the  extremities,  and  there  is  marked 
facial pallor with severe cyanosis of the lips and nail beds. Depending 
on the degree of cerebral perfusion, a patient in shock may converse 
normally or be confused.

Heart Rate
The heart rate can vary from marked bradycardia to a rapid regular 
or  irregular  tachycardia,  depending  on  the  underlying  rhythm  and 
degree of LV failure. Most commonly the pulse is rapid and regular 
initially (sinus tachycardia at 100 to 110 beats/minute) and slows as 
the  patients  pain  and  anxiety  are  relieved;  premature  ventricular 
beats are common.

Blood Pressure
Most patients with uncomplicated STEMI are normotensive, although 
the reduced stroke volume accompanying the tachycardia can cause 
declines in systolic and pulse pressure and elevation of diastolic pres-
sure. In previously normotensive patients, a hypertensive response is 
occasionally seen during the first few hours, presumably as a conse-
quence of adrenergic discharge secondary to pain, anxiety, and agita-
tion.  Previously  hypertensive  patients  often  become  normotensive 
without  treatment  after  STEMI,  although  many  of  them  eventually 
regain their elevated levels of blood pressure, generally 3 to 6 months 
after infarction. In patients with massive infarction, arterial pressure 
falls acutely because of LV dysfunction and may be exacerbated by 
morphine and/or nitrates, which cause venous pooling; as recovery 
occurs, arterial pressure tends to return to preinfarction levels.

Patients in cardiogenic shock by definition have systolic pressure 
below 90 mm Hg and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. Hypo-
tension  alone  does  not  necessarily  signify  cardiogenic  shock, 
however; some patients with inferior infarction and activation of the 
Bezold-Jarisch  reflex  may  also  transiently  have  systolic  blood  pres-
sure below 90 mm Hg. Their hypotension eventually resolves sponta-
neously,  although  the  process  can  be  accelerated  by  intravenous 
atropine (0.5 to 1 mg) and assumption of the Trendelenburg position. 
Other patients who are initially only slightly hypotensive may dem-
onstrate gradually falling blood pressure with a progressive reduction 
in  cardiac  output  over  a  period  of  several  hours  or  days  as  cardio-
genic shock develops because of increasing ischemia and extension 
of  infarction  (Fig.  51-14).  Evidence  of  autonomic  hyperactivity  is 
common and varies in type with the location of the infarction. More 
than  half  of  patients  with  inferior  STEMI  have  evidence  of  excess 
parasympathetic stimulation, with hypotension, bradycardia, or both 
evident  during  initial  evaluation,  whereas  approximately  half  of 
patients with anterior STEMI show signs of sympathetic excess and 
have hypertension, tachycardia, or both.

Temperature and Respiration
Fever,  a  nonspecific  response  to  tissue  necrosis,  develops  in  most 
patients with extensive STEMI within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of 
infarction. Body temperature often begins to rise within 4 to 8 hours 
after the onset of infarction, and rectal temperature may reach 38.3°C 
to 38.9°C (101°F to 102°F). The fever usually resolves by the fourth or 
fifth day after infarction.

The respiratory rate may rise slightly soon after the development of 
STEMI; in patients without heart failure, it results from anxiety and pain 
and returns to normal with treatment of the physical and psychologi-
cal discomfort. In patients with LV failure, the respiratory rate corre-
lates with the severity of the failure; patients with pulmonary edema 
may  have  respiratory  rates  exceeding  40  per  minute.  However,  the 
respiratory rate is not necessarily elevated in patients with cardiogenic 
shock.  Cheyne-Stokes  (periodic)  respiration  may  occur  in  elderly 
individuals with cardiogenic shock or heart failure, particularly after 
opiate therapy or in the presence of cerebrovascular disease.

Jugular Venous Pulse
The  jugular  venous  pulse  is  usually  normal.  The  a  wave  may  be 
prominent in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to LV 

failure or reduced compliance. In contrast, RV infarction (regardless 
of  whether  it  accompanies  LV  infarction)  often  results  in  marked 
jugular venous distention and, when complicated by necrosis or isch-
emia of RV papillary muscles, in the tall c-v waves of tricuspid regur-
gitation. Patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock generally have 
elevated  jugular  venous  pressure.  In  patients  with  STEMI,  hypoten-
sion, and hypoperfusion (findings that may resemble those of patients 
with cardiogenic shock) who have flat neck veins, the depression in 
LV performance is probably related, at least in part, to hypovolemia. 
Differentiation can be made only by assessing LV performance with 
echocardiography or by measuring LV filling pressure with a pulmo-
nary artery flotation catheter.

Carotid Pulse
Palpation  of  the  carotid  arterial  pulse  provides  a  clue  to  LV  stroke 
volume:  a  small  pulse  suggests  reduced  stroke  volume,  whereas  a 
sharp, brief upstroke often occurs in patients with mitral regurgitation 
or  a  ruptured  ventricular  septum  with  a  left-to-right  shunt.  Pulsus 
alternans reflects severe LV dysfunction.

The Chest
Moist rales are audible in patients in whom LV failure and/or a reduc-
tion  in  LV  compliance  with  STEMI  develops.  Diffuse  wheezing  can 
occur in patients with severe LV failure. Cough with hemoptysis, sug-
gesting pulmonary embolism with infarction, can also occur. In 1967, 
Thomas  Killip  proposed  a  prognostic  classification  scheme  on  the 
basis  of  the  presence  and  severity  of  rales  in  patients  with  STEMI. 
Class  I  patients  are  free  of  rales  and  a  third  heart  sound.  Class  II 
patients have rales, but only to a mild to moderate degree (<50% of 
lung fields), and may or may not have an S3. Patients in class III have 
rales in more than half of each lung field and frequently have pulmo-
nary  edema.  Finally,  class  IV  patients  are  in  cardiogenic  shock. 
Despite the overall improvement in the mortality rate that has now 
been  achieved  in  each  class,  when  compared  with  data  observed 
during  original  development  of  the  classification  scheme,  it  still 
remains  useful  today,  as  evidenced  by  data  from  large  MI  trials  of 
patients with STEMI.73,74

Cardiac Examination
Palpation
Palpation of the precordium may yield normal results, but in patients 
with transmural STEMI, it more commonly reveals a presystolic pulsa-
tion  synchronous  with  an  audible  fourth  heart  sound,  a  finding 
reflecting  vigorous  left  atrial  contraction  filling  a  ventricle  with 
reduced  compliance.  In  patients  with  LV  systolic  dysfunction,  an 
outward  movement  of  the  left  ventricle  can  be  palpated  in  early 
diastole, coincident with a third heart sound.

Auscultation

HEART  SOUNDS.  The heart sounds, particularly the first sound, 
are frequently muffled and occasionally inaudible immediately after 
an infarct, and their intensity increases during convalescence. A soft 
first  heart  sound  may  also  reflect  prolongation  of  the  PR  interval. 
Patients  with  marked  ventricular  dysfunction  and/or  left  bundle 
branch  block  may  have  paradoxical  splitting  of  the  second  heart 
sound.

A  fourth  heart  sound  is  almost  universally  present  in  patients  in 
sinus rhythm with STEMI, but it has limited diagnostic value because 
it is commonly audible in most patients with chronic ischemic heart 
disease  and  is  recordable,  although  not  often  audible,  in  many 
normal subjects older than 45 years.

A third heart sound in patients with STEMI usually reflects severe 
LV dysfunction with elevated ventricular filling pressure. It is caused 
by rapid deceleration of transmitral blood flow during protodiastolic 
filling of the left ventricle and is typically heard in patients with large 
infarctions. This sound is detected best at the apex with the patient 
in  the  left  lateral  recumbent  position.  A  third  heart  sound  may  be 
caused not only by LV failure but also by increased inflow into the 
left  ventricle,  as  occurs  when  mitral  regurgitation  or  a  ventricular 
septal  defect  complicates  STEMI.  Third  and  fourth  heart  sounds

emanating  from  the  left  ventricle  are  heard  best  at  the  apex;  in 
patients with RV infarcts, these sounds can be heard along the left 
sternal border and increase on inspiration.

MURMURS.  Systolic murmurstransient or persistentare com-
monly audible in patients with STEMI and generally result from mitral 
regurgitation secondary to dysfunction of the mitral valve apparatus 
(papillary muscle dysfunction, LV dilation). A new, prominent, apical 
holosystolic murmur accompanied by a thrill may represent rupture 
of  a  head  of  a  papillary  muscle  (see  Chapter  52).  The  findings  in 
cases of rupture of the interventricular septum are similar, although 
the  murmur  and  thrill  are  usually  most  prominent  along  the  left 
sternal border and may be audible at the right sternal border as well. 
The systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation (caused by RV failure 
because  of  pulmonary  hypertension  and/or  RV  infarction  or  by 
infarction  of  an  RV  papillary  muscle)  is  also  heard  along  the  left 
sternal border. It is characteristically intensified by inspiration and is 
accompanied  by  a  prominent  c-v  wave  in  the  jugular  venous  pulse 
and an RV fourth sound.

FRICTION RUBS.  Pericardial friction rubs may be heard in patients 
with  STEMI,  especially  in  those  sustaining  large  transmural  infarc-
tions.75 Rubs are notorious for their evanescence and hence are prob-
ably even more common than reported. Although friction rubs can 
be  heard  within  24  hours  or  as  late  as  2  weeks  after  the  onset  of 
infarction,  they  occur  most  commonly  on  the  second  or  third  day. 
Occasionally, in patients with extensive infarction, a loud rub can be 
heard for many days. Patients with STEMI and a pericardial friction 
rub may have a pericardial effusion on echocardiographic study, but 
it  only  rarely  causes  the  classic  electrocardiographic  changes  of 
pericarditis. Delayed onset of the rub and the associated discomfort 
of pericarditis (as late as 3 months after infarction) is characteristic 
of the now rare post-MI (Dressler) syndrome.

Pericardial  rubs  are  most  readily  audible  along  the  left  sternal 
border or just inside the apical impulse. Loud rubs may be audible 
over  the  entire  precordium  and  even  over  the  back.  Occasionally, 
only the systolic portion of a rub is heard, which requires distinction 
from  a  systolic  murmur,  such  as  might  result  from  rupture  of  the 
ventricular septum or mitral regurgitation.

Other Findings
Fundi
Hypertension, diabetes, and generalized atherosclerosis commonly 
accompany  STEMI  and  can  produce  characteristic  changes  in  the 
fundus.  A  funduscopic  examination  may  provide  information  con-
cerning  the  underlying  vascular  status,  which  can  be  particularly 
useful in patients unable to provide a detailed history.

Abdomen
Patients often interpret pain in the abdomen associated with nausea, 
vomiting,  restlessness,  and  even  abdominal  distention  as  a  sign  of 
indigestion, and it results in self-medication with antacids; it can also 
suggest an acute abdominal process to the physician. Right-sided heart 
failure, characterized by hepatomegaly and a positive abdominojugu-
lar reflux, is unusual in patients with acute LV infarction but occurs in 
patients with severe and prolonged LV failure or RV infarction.

Extremities
Coronary  atherosclerosis  is  often  associated  with  systemic  athero-
sclerosis,  and  therefore  patients  with  STEMI  may  have  a  history  of 
intermittent  claudication  and  demonstrate  the  physical  findings  of 
peripheral  vascular  disease  (see  Chapter  58).  Thus  diminished 
peripheral arterial pulses, loss of hair, and atrophic skin in the lower 
extremities  may  be  noted  in  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease. 
Peripheral edema is a manifestation of RV failure and, like congestive 
hepatomegaly, is unusual in patients with acute LV infarction. Cyano-
sis of the nail beds is common in patients with severe LV failure and 
is particularly striking in patients in cardiogenic shock.

Neuropsychiatric Findings
Except  for  the  altered  mental  status  that  occurs  in  patients  with  
STEMI  who  have  markedly  reduced  cardiac  output  and  cerebral 

1087

hypoperfusion,  findings  on  neurologic  examination  are  normal 
unless  the  patient  has  suffered  cerebral  embolism  secondary  to  a 
mural thrombus. The coincidence between these two conditions can 
be explained by systemic hypotension caused by STEMI precipitating 
a cerebral infarction and the converse, as well as by mural emboli 
from the left ventricle causing cerebral emboli.

Patients  with  STEMI  frequently  exhibit  alterations  in  their  emo-
tional  state,  including  intense  anxiety,  denial,  and  depression. 
Medical  staff  caring  for  patients  with  STEMI  must  be  sensitive  to 
changes in the patients emotional state; a calm, professional atmo-
sphere, with thorough explanations of equipment and prognosis, can 
help alleviate the distress associated with STEMI.

LaboratoryFindings
Serum Markers of Cardiac Damage
Myocardial  injury  can  be  detected  by  the  presence  of  circulating 
proteins released from damaged myocardial cells. Even though the 
availability  of  serum  and  plasma  cardiac  markers  with  markedly 
enhanced sensitivity for myocardial injury has enabled clinicians to 
identify  much  lower  levels  of  injury,  it  is  important  to  clarify  that 
biochemical  tests  of  myocardial  injury  do  not  provide  any  direct 
insight into the cause of the damage.76,77 MI is the diagnosis given to 
myocardial  injury  that  results  from  ischemia  (Fig.  51-15).1  Other 
nonischemic insults, such as myocarditis or direct myocardial toxins, 
may result in myocardial injury but should not be labeled MI. More-
over, the enhanced ability to detect myocardial damage has increased 
the  number  of  cases  of  myocardial  injury  that  result  from  non
plaque-related  clinical  events,  thus  necessitating  the  establishment 
of  new  criteria  for  MI  (see  Table  51-1,  51-2,  and  51-4)  that  place  the 
injury in clinical context.1

Although the following section applies more to diagnostic decision 
making for patients with suspected ACS without ST-segment elevation 
(see  Chapter  53),  this  chapter  contains  a  general  discussion  of 
cardiac  biomarkers  because  of  the  overlapping  pathophysiologic 
concepts  and  methodology  when  biomarkers  are  used  to  evaluate 
patients with STEMI. It should be emphasized that clinicians should 
not  wait  for  the  results  of  biomarker  assays  to  initiate  treatment  of 
patients  with  STEMI.  Given  the  time  urgency  for  reperfusion  in 
patients  with  STEMI,  the  12-lead  ECG  should  serve  to  initiate  such 
strategies.

Necrosis compromises the integrity of the sarcolemmal membrane; 
intracellular  macromolecules  (serum  and  plasma  cardiac  markers) 
begin  to  diffuse  into  the  cardiac  interstitium  and  ultimately  into  
the  microvasculature  and  lymphatics  in  the  region  of  the  infarct  
(Fig.  51-16;  also  see  Table  51-4).  The  rate  of  appearance  of 
these  macromolecules  in  the  peripheral  circulation  depends  on 
several  factors,  including  intracellular  location,  molecular  weight, 
local  blood  and  lymphatic  flow,  and  the  rate  of  elimination  from 
blood.78

Cardiac-Specific Troponins
The preferred biomarker to detect myocardial injury is cardiac tropo-
nin,  which  consists  of  three  subunits  that  regulate  the  calcium-
mediated  contractile  process  of  striated  muscle.1  These  subunit 
include troponin C, which binds Ca2+; troponin I (TnI), which binds 
to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interactions; and troponin T (TnT), 
which binds to tropomyosin, thereby attaching the troponin complex 
to the thin filament (Fig. 51-16). Although most TnT is incorporated in 
the  troponin  complex,  approximately  6%  to  8%  is  dissolved  in  the 
cytosol; in contrast, approximately 2% to 3% of TnI is found in a cyto-
solic  pool.  Following  myocyte  injury,  the  initial  release  of  cardiac-
specific TnT and TnI is from the cytosolic pool, followed subsequently 
by release from the structural (myofilament-bound) pool (Fig. 51-16).78 
Different genes encode TnT and TnI in cardiac and skeletal muscle, 
thus permitting the production of specific antibodies for the cardiac 
forms  (cTnT  and  cTnI),  which  enables  quantitative  measurement  of 
them (Fig. 51-16).78,79 Detection of a rise and fall in cTnT or cTnI in the 
appropriate clinical setting is now at the center of the new diagnostic 
criteria for MI.1

HIGH-SENSITIVITY  CARDIAC  TRO-
PONIN.  Newer  high-sensitivity  assays 
that  deliver  enhanced  analytic  perfor-
mance  enable  more  precise  measure-
ment  of  very  low  concentrations  of 
cardiac-specific  troponin.  Experts  rec-
ommend  that  the  term  high-sensitivity 
troponin (hsTn) be reserved for assays 
that  can  detect  cardiac  troponin  in 
more than 50% of an apparently healthy 
population.78,79  Such  assays  are  sub-
stantially more sensitive than previous-
generation  assays  but  also  have 
diminished  clinical  specificity  for  MI 
because  they  detect  true  myocardial 
injury in a variety of other clinical set-
tings.76 Nevertheless, in multiple studies 
of  patients  with  nontraumatic  chest 
pain, hsTn assays have improved overall 
diagnostic accuracy and enabled earlier 
detection  of  myocardial  injury81,82  (see 
Fig.  51-16).  Moreover,  even  low-level 
elevations in cardiac troponin detected 
with  sensitive  assays  are  associated 
with a worse prognosis.83

FIGURE51-15  Myocardial ischemia and subsequent myocardial injury can result from a variety of clinical entities, 
including renal failure, heart failure, tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia, and cardiac or noncardiac procedures. Each 
of these scenarios can result in myocardial injury with cell death marked by the release of detectable circulating levels 
of cardiac troponin. However, each of these entities can also be associated with MI when there is clinical evidence of 
acute myocardial ischemia with a typical rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin levels. (From Thygesen K, Alpert JS, Jaffe 
AS, et al: Third universal definition of myocardial infarction. J Am Coll Cardiol 60:1581, 2012.)

Creatine Kinase-MB
If  a  cardiac-specific  troponin  assay  is 
not  available,  CK-MB  measured  with  a 
mass  assay 
is  the  best  alternative. 
Cardiac  muscle  contains  both  the  MM 
and MB isoenzymes of CK. Other tissues 
can  contain  small  quantities  of  the  MB 
isoenzyme  of  CK,  including  the  small 
intestine,  tongue,  diaphragm,  uterus, 
and  prostate.  Strenuous  exercise,  par-
ticularly in trained long-distance runners 
or  professional  athletes,  can  cause  an 
elevation  in  both  total  CK  and  CK-MB. 
Because CK-MB can be detected in the blood of healthy subjects, the 
cutoff value for abnormal elevation of CK-MB is usually set a few units 
above the upper reference limit for a given laboratory (see Fig. 51-16). 
Like cardiac-specific troponin, the diagnosis of MI requires a maximal 
concentration of CK-MB exceeding the 99th percentile of values for 
sex-specific reference levels on two successive samples in a rise and 
fall pattern.1 CK-MB is inaccurate in circumstances involving skeletal 
muscle injury.

Recommendations for Measurement of Serum Markers
All  patients  with  suspected  MI  should  undergo  measurement  of 
cardiac-specific troponin as soon as possible after the initial encoun-
ter.  In  patients  with  STEMI,  the  results  of  biomarker  assessment 
should  not  delay  interventions  to  achieve  immediate  reperfusion. 
From  a  cost-effectiveness  perspective,  measuring  both  a  cardiac-
specific troponin and CK-MB is unnecessary.1 Routine diagnosis of MI 
can  be  accomplished  by  obtaining  measurements  at  initial  evalua-
tion  and  then  3  to  6  hours  later  (see  Table  50-1).1  Later  testing  is 
required only when uncertainty exists regarding the onset of pain or 
when stuttering symptoms occur.

The universal definition of MI recommends classifying infarctions 
into five types (see Table 51-2), along with the magnitude of the infarc-
tion expressed as the fold elevation in cardiac biomarkers above the 
99th percentile of the upper reference limit. An example from a clini-
cal  trial  comparing  prasugrel  with  clopidogrel  as  supportive  anti-
platelet  therapy  for  moderate-  to  high-risk  ACS  patients  undergoing 
PCI is shown in Figure 51-18.84

Other  Biomarkers.  Other  biomarkers  may  be  used  to  noninva-
sively assess the potential causes and complications of MI. C-reactive 
protein (CRP) rises substantially in the setting of STEMI as a result of 

When interpreting the results of assays for cTnT or cTnI, clinicians 
must recognize several analytic issues.77,80 cTnI assays are produced 
by multiple manufacturers using different troponin epitopes for detec-
tion, which has resulted in varying reference levels.78,79 A single manu-
facturer  has  commercialized  cTnT,  thereby  leading  to  greater 
uniformity of the recommended cutoff. The release pattern of tropo-
nin  complexes,  conformational  changes,  and  degradation  into 
various  troponin  fragments  may  differentially  affect  the  results  of 
various  commercial  assays.  Such  post-translational  modifications 
may provide insight into the underlying cause and timing of release 
(e.g.,  differentiating  ischemia  from  myocarditis),  but  such  applica-
tions remain investigational.

CUTOFF VALUES.  Variations in the cutoff concentration for abnor-
mal levels of cTnI in the clinically available immunoassays result in 
part from the different specificities of the antibodies used for detect-
ing free and complexed cTnI. Thus clinicians should apply evidence-
based cutoff values for the particular assay used in their laboratory.78,79 
For  both  cTnT  and  cTnI,  the  definition  of  an  abnormally  increased 
level is a value exceeding that of 99% of a reference control group. 
Assays that have a level of imprecision (i.e., coefficient of variation) 
of less than 10% at the specific 99th percentile cutoff are optimal for 
clinical practice.1

In  patients  with  MI,  cTnT  and  cTnI  first  begin  to  rise  by  approxi-
mately 3 hours after the onset of chest pain. Because of continuous 
release from a degenerating contractile apparatus in necrotic myo-
cytes, elevations in cTnI may persist for 7 to 10 days after MI; eleva-
tions in cTnT may persist for up to 10 to 14 days. The prolonged time 
course of the elevation in cTnT and cTnI is advantageous for the late 
diagnosis  of  MI  (Fig.  51-16).  Patients  with  STEMI  who  undergo  suc-
cessful recanalization of the infarct-related artery have a rapid release 
of cardiac troponins, which can indicate reperfusion (Fig. 51-17).

FIGURE51-16  Release of biomarkers into the circulation begins with prolonged 
ischemia  and  subsequent  necrosis  that  results  in  loss  of  integrity  of  the  cellular 
membranes. After disruption of the sarcolemmal membrane of the cardiomyocyte, 
the cytoplasmic pool of biomarkers is released first (left-most arrow in the bottom 
portion  of  the  figure).  Markers  such  as  myoglobin  and  CK  isoforms  are  released 
rapidly, and blood levels rise quickly above the cutoff limit. More protracted release 
of biomarkers from the disintegrating myofilaments follows and may continue for 
several days (three-headed arrow). Cardiac troponin levels rise to about 20 to 50 
times the upper reference limit (the 99th percentile of values in a reference control 
group)  in  patients  who  have  classic  acute  MI  and  sustain  sufficient  myocardial 
necrosis  that  results  in  abnormally  elevated  levels  of  CK-MB.  Clinicians  can  now 
diagnose episodes of microinfarction by more sensitive assays that detect even small 
elevations in cardiac troponin above the upper reference limit, even though levels 
of CK-MB and troponin determined from older generations of assays may still be 
below the MI decision limit. Other causes of myocardial injury, such as renal failure 
or  pulmonary  embolism,  can  lead  to  detectable  levels  of  cardiac  troponin  even 
without any coronary artery disease (lower panel). AMI = acute MI; CAD = coro-
nary artery disease; UA = unstable angina. (Modified from Antman EM: Decision

the inflammatory response to myocyte necrosis and is associated with 
the subsequent risk for death or heart failure. BNP and related pep-
tides  reflect  the  hemodynamic  impact  of  the  MI  and  are  associated 
with prognosis. Although both BNP and CRP enhance risk assessment, 
no clear guidance is available on how to structure specific therapeutic 
maneuvers in the setting of STEMI in response to these biomarkers.85 

Future  studies  evaluating  novel  biomarkers  should  focus  on  unmet 
clinical scenarios such as earlier detection of MI, differentiation of type 
I from type II MI, and improved risk stratification.86 Markers such as 
copeptin,  pregnancy-associated  plasma  protein-A  (PAPP-A),  fms-like 
tyrosine kinase (Flt-1), heart-type fatty acidbinding protein (H-FABP), 
and growth differential factor-15 (GDF-15) may offer insight into the 
different pathophysiologic processes in MI.63,87

Other Laboratory Measurements
Serum Lipids (See Chapter 45).  During the first 24 to 48 hours 
after admission, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol remain at or near baseline values, but they generally fall 
after that. The fall in HDL cholesterol after STEMI is greater than the 
fall  in  total  cholesterol;  thus  the  ratio  of  total  cholesterol  to  HDL 
cholesterol  is  no  longer  useful  for  risk  assessment  unless  measured 
early after MI. A lipid profile should be obtained on all patients with 
STEMI who are admitted within 24 hours of symptoms.88 Lipid levels 
may  still  be  clinically  useful  for  patients  admitted  beyond  24  to  48 
hours,89 although more accurate determinations of serum lipid levels 
are obtained about 8 weeks after the infarction has occurred.

Hematologic  Findings.  Elevation  of  the  white  blood  cell  count 
usually develops within 2 hours after the onset of chest pain, reaches 
a peak 2 to 4 days after infarction, and returns to normal in 1 week; 
the  peak  white  blood  cell  count  generally  ranges  between  12  and   
15 × 103/mL but occasionally rises to as high as 20 × 103/mL in patients 
with large STEMI. Frequently there is an increase in the percentage of 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a shift of the differential count to 
band forms. An epidemiologic association has been reported, with a 
worse  angiographic  appearance  of  the  culprit  lesions  and  increased 
risk for adverse clinical outcomes the higher the white blood cell count 
at initial evaluation in patients with an ACS.90

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually normal during 
the first day or two after infarction, even though fever and leukocy-
tosis may be present. It then rises to a peak on the fourth or fifth day 
and may remain elevated for several weeks. The increase in the ESR 
does not correlate well with the size of the infarction or with prog-
nosis. The hematocrit often increases during the first few days after 
infarction as a consequence of hemoconcentration.

The hemoglobin value at initial evaluation of a patient with STEMI 
powerfully  and  independently  predicts  major  cardiovascular  events. 
Of  note  is  a  J-shaped  relationship  between  baseline  hemoglobin 
values and clinical events. Cardiovascular mortality increases progres-
sively as the initial hemoglobin value falls below 14 to 15 g/dL; con-
versely, it also rises as the hemoglobin level increases above 17 g/dL. 
The increased risk from anemia is probably related to diminished tissue 
delivery of oxygen, whereas the increased risk with polycythemia may 
be relates to an increase in blood viscosity.91

Electrocardiography (See Chapter 12)
Serial changes on the ECG develop in most patients with STEMI, but 
many factors limit the usefulness of the ECG in diagnosing and local-
izing  MI:  the  extent  of  myocardial  injury,  the  age  of  the  infarct,  its

patients who do not undergo reperfusion is shown in the solid blue and red curves

smaller area under the curve and limitation of infarct size. AMI = acute MI. (Modi-

location, the presence of conduction defects, the presence of previ-
ous infarcts or acute pericarditis, changes in electrolyte concentra-
tions, and the administration of cardioactive drugs. Abnormalities in 
the ST segment and T wave are quite nonspecific and may occur in 
a variety of conditions, including stable and unstable angina pectoris, 
ventricular hypertrophy, acute and chronic pericarditis, myocarditis, 
early  repolarization,  electrolyte  imbalance,  shock,  and  metabolic 
disorders, as well as following the administration of digitalis. Serial 
ECGs help in differentiating these conditions from STEMI. Transient 
changes favor angina or electrolyte disturbances, whereas persistent 
changes argue for infarction if other causes such as shock, adminis-
tration of digitalis, and persistent metabolic disorders can be elimi-
nated. Nevertheless, serial standard 12-lead ECGs remain an extremely 
useful method for the detection and localization of MI.92

Analysis  of  the  constellation  of  ECG  leads  showing  ST  elevation 
may also be useful for identifying the site of occlusion in the infarct 
artery (see Fig. 51-5).31 The extent of ST deviation on the ECG, location 
of  the  infarction,  and  the  QRS  duration  correlate  with  the  risk  for 
adverse outcomes. Even when left bundle branch block is present on 
the ECG, MI can be diagnosed when striking ST-segment deviation is 
present  beyond  what  can  be  explained  by  the  conduction  defect 
(Table 51-5). In addition to the diagnostic and prognostic informa-
tion contained within the 12-lead ECG, the degree of ST-segment reso-
lution provides valuable noninvasive information about the success 
of reperfusion for STEMI, regardless of whether it was achieved with 
fibrinolysis or primary coronary intervention (see Chapter 52).93,94

Although  general  agreement  exists  on  electrocardiographic  and 
vector cardiographic criteria for the recognition of infarction of the 
anterior and inferior myocardial walls, less agreement exists on cri-
teria for lateral and posterior infarcts. A consensus group has recom-
mended  elimination  of  the  term  posterior  and  suggests  using 
lateral to be consistent with current understanding of the segmental 
anatomy of the heart as it sits in the thorax.31 The most recent univer-
sal  definition  of  MI,  however,  retains  the  category  of  posterior  MI.1

and inferior or lateral Q waves have an increased incidence of iso-
lated occlusion of a dominant left circumflex coronary artery without 
collateral  circulation;  such  patients  have  a  lower  ejection  fraction, 
increased end-systolic volume, and higher complication rate than do 
those  with  inferior  infarction  because  of  isolated  occlusion  of  the 
right coronary artery.

Although most patients bear the changes from an MI on the ECG 
for the rest of their lives, particularly if Q waves evolve, in a substantial 
minority  the  typical  changes  disappear,  the  Q  waves  regress,  and 
findings  on  the  ECG  can  even  return  to  normal  after  a  number  of 
years.  Under  many  circumstances,  Q  wave  patterns  simulate  MI.

by  producing  a  pattern  of  pseudoinfarction  include  ventricular 
hypertrophy,  conduction  disturbances,  preexcitation,  primary  myo-
cardial disease, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, amyloid heart 
disease, primary and metastatic tumors of the heart, traumatic heart 
disease,  intracranial  hemorrhage,  hyperkalemia,  pericarditis,  early 
repolarization, and cardiac sarcoidosis.

Force on Practice Guidelines. J Am Coll Cardiol 61:e78, 2013.

Q-Wave and NonQ-Wave Infarction
The  presence  or  absence  of  Q  waves  on  the  surface  ECG  does  not 
reliably distinguish between transmural and nontransmural (suben-
docardial) MI. Q waves on the ECG signify abnormal electrical activ-
ity  but  are  not  synonymous  with  irreversible  myocardial  damage. 
Also, the absence of Q waves may simply reflect the insensitivity of 
the  standard  12-lead  ECG,  especially  in  zones  of  the  left  ventricle 
supplied by the left circumflex artery (see Fig. 51-5).31

Ischemia at a Distance
Patients  with  new  Q  waves  and  ST-segment  elevation  diagnostic  of 
STEMI  in  one  territory  often  have  ST-segment  depression  in  other 
territories.  These  additional  ST-segment  changes,  which  imply  a  
poor  prognosis,  result  either  from  ischemia  in  a  territory  other  
than  the  area  of  infarction,  termed  ischemia  at  a  distance,  or  from 
reciprocal electrical phenomena. Much attention has been directed 
toward  associated  ST-segment  depression  in  the  anterior  leads  
when it occurs in patients with acute inferior STEMI. Yet despite the 
clinical  importance  of  differentiation  among  causes  of  anterior 
ST-segment depression in such patients, including anterior ischemia, 
inferolateral  wall  infarction,  and  true  reciprocal  changes,  such  dif-
ferentiation cannot be made reliably by electrocardiographic or even

vector  cardiographic  techniques.  Although  precordial  ST-segment 
depression  is  more  commonly  associated  with  extensive  infarction 
of the lateral or inferior septal segments than with anterior wall sub-
endocardial  ischemia,  imaging  techniques  such  as  echocardiogra-
phy  are  necessary  to  ascertain  whether  an  anterior  wall  motion 
abnormality is present.

Right Ventricular Infarction
ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1, V3R through 
V6R) is a relatively sensitive and specific sign of RV infarction.31 Occa-
sionally, ST-segment elevation in leads V2 and V3 results from acute 
RV infarction; this appears to occur only when injury to the left infe-
rior  wall  is  minimal.95  Usually,  the  concurrent  inferior  wall  injury 
suppresses  this  anterior  ST-segment  elevation  resulting  from  RV 
injury.  Similarly,  RV  infarction  appears  to  reduce  the  anterior 
ST-segment depression often observed with inferior wall MI. A QS or 
QR  pattern  in  leads  V3R  and/or  V4R  also  suggests  RV  myocardial 
necrosis but has less predictive accuracy than does ST-segment eleva-
tion in these leads.

Imaging
Noninvasive imaging provides important diagnostic and prognostic 
information in patients with MI. In most cases of STEMI, unless the 
ECG is nondiagnostic or the clinical scenario is questionable, imaging 
is  not  required  for  diagnosisbut  imaging  plays  many  roles  after 
diagnosis, including determining the extent of the infarct, the pres-
ence  of  mechanical  complications,  and  the  overall  function  of  the 
right and left ventricles.

Roentgenography (See Chapter 15)
The  initial  chest  roentgenogram  in  patients  with  STEMI  is  almost 
invariably a portable film obtained in the emergency department or 
cardiac  care  unit.  When  present,  prominent  pulmonary  vascular 
markings  on  the  roentgenogram  reflect  elevated  LV  end-diastolic 
pressure, but significant temporal discrepancies can occur because 
of what have been termed diagnostic lags and post-therapeutic lags. 
Up  to  12  hours  can  elapse  before  pulmonary  edema  accumulates 
after  ventricular  filling  pressure  has  become  elevated.  The  post-
therapeutic phase lag represents a longer time interval; up to 2 days 
is required for pulmonary edema to be resorbed and the radiographic 
signs of pulmonary congestion to clear after ventricular filling pres-
sure has returned toward normal. The degree of congestion and the 
size of the left side of the heart on the chest film are useful for defin-
ing groups of patients with STEMI who have an increased risk for fatal 
complications.

Echocardiography (See Chapter 14)
The relative portability of echocardiographic equipment makes this 
technique ideal for the assessment of patients with MI.96 In patients 
with chest pain compatible with MI but with a nondiagnostic ECG, 
the  finding  on  echocardiography  of  a  distinct  region  of  disordered 
contraction can support the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Echo-
cardiography can also provide some help in evaluating patients with 
chest  pain  and  a  nondiagnostic  ECG  who  are  suspected  of  having 
aortic  dissection.  Identification  of  an  intimal  flap  consistent  with 
aortic dissection is a critical observation because the finding would 
drive critical changes in therapeutic strategy (see Chapter 57), but 
transthoracic  echocardiography  has  poor  sensitivity  for  detecting 
aortic dissection in comparison to other imaging modalities such as 
computed tomography (CT) angiography.

LV function estimated from echocardiograms correlates well with 
measurements  from  angiography  and  is  useful  in  establishing  the 
prognosis after MI.96 Furthermore, early use of echocardiography can 
aid in early detection of potentially viable but stunned myocardium 
(contractile  reserve),  residual  provokable  ischemia,  patients  at  risk 
for the development of congestive heart failure after MI, and mechani-
cal complications of MI. Newer techniques also provide information 
regarding  the  success  of  myocardial  tissue-level  reperfusion.97 
Although transthoracic imaging is adequate in most patients, some 
patients have poor echocardiographic windows, especially if they are

undergoing  mechanical  ventilation.  In  such  patients,  transesopha-
geal  echocardiography  can  be  performed  safely  and  may  help  
in  evaluating  ventricular  septal  defects  and  papillary  muscle 
dysfunction.10

Doppler techniques allow assessment of blood flow in the cardiac 
chambers and across cardiac valves. When used in conjunction with 
echocardiography, Doppler interrogation can help in detecting and 
assessing the severity of mitral or tricuspid regurgitation after STEMI, 
the  site  of  acute  ventricular  septal  rupture,  quantification  of  shunt 
flow  across  the  resulting  defect,  and  assessment  of  acute  cardiac 
tamponade.10

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (See Chapter 17)
In addition to localizing and sizing the area of infarction, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) techniques permit early recognition of MI 
and can provide an assessment of the severity of the ischemic insult. 
This modality is attractive because of its ability to assess perfusion 
of infarcted and noninfarcted tissue, as well as reperfused myocar-
dium; to identify areas of jeopardized but not infarcted myocardium; 
to identify myocardial edema, fibrosis, wall thinning, and hypertro-
phy; to assess ventricular chamber size and segmental wall motion; 
and to identify the temporal transition between ischemia and infarc-
tion  (Fig.  51-19).98-101  MRI  has  limited  application  during  the  acute 
phase because of the need to transport patients with MI to the MRI 

facility, but as discussed later, it is an extremely useful imaging tech-
nique during the subacute and chronic phases of MI.

Contrast-enhanced CMR with gadolinium can define areas of myo-
cardial necrosis accurately. The transmural extent of late gadolinium 
enhancement (LGE) in regions of dysfunctional myocardium accu-
rately predicts the likelihood of recovery of contractile function after 
successful restoration of coronary flow via mechanical revasculariza-
tion.102  Numerous  clinical  studies  have  also  demonstrated  the  high 
sensitivity of LGE (delayed hyperenhancement) of CMR in detect-
ing  small  amounts  of  myonecrosis.  LGE  accurately  identifies  the 
infarct zone when compared with histologic examination. The best 
predictor of return to normal ventricular wall thickening is less than 
25% transmurality of LGE. LGE is also a sensitive technique for detect-
ing RV infarcts.99

In  patients  with  a  previous  MI,  estimation  of  the  size  of  the  peri-
infarct zone by CMR with the delayed-enhancement technique pro-
vides incremental prognostic value beyond LV volume and ejection 
fraction.  Besides  detecting  infarction,  this  imaging  technique  can 
characterize the presence and size of microvascular obstruction as 
a result of infarction, which may be an even poorer prognostic finding 
than  LGE  is.  Clinically  unrecognized  myocardial  scar  detected  by 
LGE imaging is associated with high risk for adverse cardiac events 
in patients with signs and symptoms of coronary artery disease but 
without a history of infarction.100

of  the  infarct  on  ventricular  func-

practical application.

cavity  dimensions  and  wall  thick-
ness,  can  detect  LV  aneurysms, 
andof  particular  importance  in 
patients  with  STEMIcan  identify 
intracardiac  thrombi.  In  the  acute 
setting, contrast-enhanced CT detects 
focal areas of MI as decreased areas 
of  enhancement.  Older 
infarcts 
show hyperenhancement. Although 
cardiac CT is a less convenient tech-
nique, it is probably more sensitive 
than  echocardiography  for  throm-
bus  detection.104  Coronary  CT  angi-
ography  is  sensitive  in  detecting 
coronary  obstructions,  particularly 
in the proximal third of the coronary 
anatomy, and may improve the diag-
nostic evaluation of patients with a 
low  to  intermediate  probability  of 
ACS,  but  it  does  not  have  a  role  
in  the  management  of  suspected 
STEMI.105

Estimation of Infarct Size

ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY.  Interest in limiting infarct size, largely 
because of the recognition that the quantity of infarcted myocardium 
has  important  prognostic  implications,  has  focused  attention  on 
accurate determination of MI size. The sum of ST-segment elevations 
measured from multiple precordial leads correlates with the extent 
of myocardial injury in patients with anterior MI.92 Yet a relationship 
exists between the number of ECG leads showing ST-segment eleva-
tion and the mortality rate: patients with 8 or 9 of 12 leads showing 
ST-segment elevation have three to four times the mortality of those 
with only 2 or 3 leads demonstrating ST-segment elevation.

CARDIAC  MARKERS.  Estimation  of  infarct  size  by  analysis  of 
serum or plasma cardiac markers requires accounting for the quan-
tity of the marker lost from the myocardium, its volume of distribu-
tion, and its release ratio. Serial measurements of proteins released 
by necrotic myocardium can be used to help determine MI size. Clini-
cally, the peak CK, CK-MB, or troponin level provides an approximate 
estimate  of  infarct  size.  Coronary  artery  reperfusion  dramatically 
changes the wash-out kinetics of necrosis markers from myocardium, 
thereby resulting in early and exaggerated peak levels (see Fig. 51-17). 
Measuring a cardiac-specific troponin level several days after STEMI, 
even in cases of successful reperfusion, may provide a reliable esti-
mate of infarct size because such late troponin measurements reflect 
delayed  release  from  the  myofilament-bound  pool  in  damaged 
myocytes.

NONINVASIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES.  The imaging modalities 
discussed above can aid in experimental and clinical assessment of 
infarct  size.  Echocardiography  remains  the  most  commonly  used 
modality for assessing infarct size and LV function, although contrast-
enhanced CMR can detect smaller degrees of ischemia and identify 
areas  of  injury  that  are  permanently  damaged  myocardium  versus 
stunned  regions,  which  may  recover.  CMR  can  also  discern  the 
regional heterogeneity of infarction patterns in patients with persis-
tently  occluded  infarct  arteries  or  severe  microvascular  occlusion 
versus  those  with  a  successfully  reperfused  macrocirculation  and 
microcirculation.100
