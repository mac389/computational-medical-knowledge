Treatment  of  patients  with  tachyarrhythmias  has  evolved  dramati-
cally over the last 40 years. Antiarrhythmic drugs were the mainstay 
of therapy until the late 1960s, when surgical therapy to cure, not just 
suppress tachyarrhythmias was developed. This mode was replaced 
by catheter ablation for better control or even cure of tachyarrhyth-
mias in the 1980s. Catheter ablation has largely replaced surgical and 
drug  therapy  for  patients  who  need  treatment  of  supraventricular 
tachycardia (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the absence 
of structural heart disease. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD) was introduced in the early 1980s and has become standard 
therapy for patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias in the pres-
ence of structural heart disease. Some patients require a combination 
of  these  forms  of  treatment  (hybrid  therapy,  such  as  an  ICD  and 
antiarrhythmic drugs or surgery and an ICD); drug therapy can also 
affect ICD function, either positively or negatively. Drug therapy for 
arrhythmias, at one time the only option, has largely been replaced 
as the mainstay of therapy by ablation or implanted devices. However, 
in  most  patients,  tachyarrhythmias  are  initially  treated  with  antiar-
rhythmic drugs, and thus they continue to have a significant role.

PHARMACOLOGICTHERAPY

The principles of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
are discussed in Chapter 9.

GeneralConsiderationsRegarding
AntiarrhythmicDrugs
Most of the antiarrhythmic drugs available (Table 35-1) can be clas-
sified  according  to  whether  they  exert  blocking  actions  predomi-
nantly on sodium, potassium, or calcium channels and whether they 
block receptors. The commonly used classification, that of Vaughan 
Williams,  is  limited  because  it  is  based  on  the  electrophysiologic 
effects exerted by an arbitrary concentration of the drug, generally 
on a laboratory preparation of normal cardiac tissue. In reality, the 
actions  of  these  drugs  are  complex  and  depend  on  tissue  type, 
degree of acute or chronic damage, heart rate, membrane potential, 
ionic  composition  of  the  extracellular  milieu,  autonomic  influence, 
genetics (see Chapter 32), age (see Chapter 76), and other factors 
(see  Table  35-1).  Many  drugs  exert  more  than  one  type  of  electro-
physiologic effect or operate indirectly, such as by altering hemody-
namics, myocardial metabolism, or autonomic neural transmission. 
Some drugs have active metabolites that exert effects different from 
those of the parent compound. Not all drugs in the same class have 
identical effects (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, and ibutilide). Whereas all 
class  III  agents  are  dramatically  different,  some  drugs  in  different 
classes have overlapping actions (e.g., class IA and class IC drugs). 
Thus,  in  vitro  studies  on  healthy  myocardium  usually  establish  the 
properties  of  antiarrhythmic  agents  rather  than  their  actual  antiar-
rhythmic properties in vivo.

Despite its limitations, the Vaughan Williams classification is widely 
known  and  provides  a  useful  communication  shorthand,  but  the 
reader is cautioned that drug actions are more complex than those 
depicted by the classification. A more realistic view of antiarrhythmic 
agents is provided by the Sicilian gambit. This approach to drug clas-
sification  is  an  attempt  to  identify  the  mechanisms  of  a  particular 
arrhythmia, to determine the vulnerable parameter of the arrhythmia 
most susceptible to modification, to define the target most likely to 
affect the vulnerable parameter, and then to select a drug that will 
modify  the  target.1  This  concept  provides  a  framework  in  which  to 
consider antiarrhythmic drugs (Table 35-2; also see Table 35-1).

Drug Classification
According to the Vaughan Williams classification, class I drugs pre-
dominantly block the fast sodium channel; they can also block potas-
sium  channels.  They,  in  turn,  are  divided  into  three  subgroups, 
classes IA, IB, and IC (Table 35-3).

Class IA
This  class  includes  drugs  that  reduce  (cid:31)Vmax  (rate  of  rise  in  action 
potential upstroke [phase 0]) and prolong the action potential dura-
tion  (APD;  see  Chapter  33)quinidine,  procainamide,  and  diso-
pyramide.  The  kinetics  of  onset  and  offset  of  class  IA  drugs  in 
blocking  the  Na+  channel  is  of  intermediate  rapidity  (less  than  5 
seconds) when compared with class IB and class IC agents.

Class IB
This class of drugs does not reduce  (cid:31)Vmax and shortens the APD
mexiletine, phenytoin, and lidocaine. The kinetics of onset and offset 
of these drugs in blocking the sodium channel is rapid (less than 500 
milliseconds).

Class IC
This class of drugs, including flecainide and propafenone, can reduce 
(cid:31)Vmax, primarily slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness 
minimally. These drugs have slow onset and offset kinetics (10 to 20 
seconds).

Class II
These drugs block beta-adrenergic receptors and include proprano-
lol, metoprolol, nadolol, carvedilol, nebivolol, and timolol.

Class III
This class of drugs predominantly blocks potassium channels (such 
as IKr) and prolongs repolarization. Included are sotalol, amiodarone, 
dronedarone, and ibutilide.

Class IV
This class of drugs predominantly blocks the slow calcium channel 
(ICa.L)verapamil,  diltiazem,  nifedipine,  and  others  (felodipine 
blocks ICa.T).

Antiarrhythmic drugs appear to cross the cell membrane and inter-
act with receptors in the membrane channels when the channels are 
in  the  rested,  activated,  or  inactivated  state  (see  Table  35-1  and 
Chapter 33), and each of these interactions is characterized by dif-
ferent  association  and  dissociation  rate  constants  of  a  drug  on  its 
receptor. Such interactions depend on voltage and time. Transitions 
among rested, activated, and inactivated states are governed by stan-
dard Hodgkin-Huxleytype equations. When the drug is bound (asso-
ciated)  to  a  receptor  site  at  or  very  close  to  the  ionic  channel  (the 
drug may not actually plug the channel), the channel cannot conduct, 
even in the activated state.

Use Dependence.  Some drugs exert greater inhibitory effects on 
the upstroke of the action potential at more rapid rates of stimulation 
and  after  longer  periods  of  stimulation,  a  characteristic  called  use 
dependence.  Use  dependence  means  that  depression  of  (cid:31)Vmax  is 
greater after the channel has been used (i.e., after action potential 
depolarization  rather  than  after  a  rest  period).  Agents  in  class  IB 
exhibit fast kinetics of onset and offset or use-dependent block of the 
fast channel; that is, they bind and dissociate quickly from receptors. 
Class IC drugs have slow kinetics, and class IA drugs are intermediate. 
With increased time spent in diastole (slower rate), a greater propor-
tion of receptors become drug free, and the drug exerts less effect.

recover  more  slowly  from  drug  actions  than  do  healthier  cells  with 
more negative (i.e., normal) membrane potentials.

Reverse  Use  Dependence.  Some  drugs  exert  greater  effects  at 
slow rates than at fast rates, a property known as reverse use depen-
dence. This is particularly true for drugs that lengthen repolarization. 
The QT interval becomes more prolonged at slow rather than at fast 
rates. This effect is not what the ideal antiarrhythmic agent would do 
because  prolongation  of  refractoriness  should  be  increased  at  fast 
rates to interrupt or to prevent a tachycardia and should be minimal 
at slow rates to avoid precipitation of torsades de pointes.

Mechanisms  of  Arrhythmia  Suppression.  Given  the  fact  that 
enhanced automaticity, triggered activity, or reentry can cause cardiac 
arrhythmias (see Chapter 33), mechanisms by which antiarrhythmic 
agents suppress arrhythmias can be postulated (see Table 35-2). Anti-
arrhythmic agents can slow the spontaneous discharge frequency of 
an automatic pacemaker by depressing the slope of diastolic depolar-
ization, shifting the threshold voltage toward zero, or hyperpolarizing 
the resting membrane potential. Mechanisms whereby different drugs 
suppress normal or abnormal automaticity may not be the same. In 
general,  however,  most  antiarrhythmic  agents  in  therapeutic  doses 
depress the automatic firing rate of spontaneously discharging ectopic 
sites while minimally affecting the discharge rate of the normal sinus 
node. Slow channel blockers such as verapamil, beta blockers such as 
propranolol, and some antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone also 
depress spontaneous discharge of the sinus node, whereas drugs that 
exert  vagolytic  effects,  such  as  disopyramide  and  quinidine,  can 
increase  the  sinus  discharge  rate.  Drugs  can  also  suppress  early  or 
delayed  afterdepolarizations  and  eliminate  triggered  arrhythmias 
related to these mechanisms.

Reentry depends critically on the interrelationships between refrac-
toriness and conduction velocity, the presence of unidirectional block 
in one of the pathways, and other factors that influence refractoriness 
and  conduction,  such  as  excitability  (see  Chapter  33).  An  antiar-
rhythmic  agent  can  stop  ongoing  reentry  that  is  already  present  or 
prevent it from starting if the drug depresses or, alternately, improves 
conduction.  For  example,  improving  conduction  can  (1)  eliminate  a 
unidirectional block so that reentry cannot begin or (2) facilitate con-
duction in the reentrant loop so that the returning wave front reenters 
too  quickly,  encounters  cells  that  are  still  refractory,  and  is  extin-
guished. A drug that depresses conduction can transform a unidirec-
tional block into a bidirectional block and thus terminate reentry or 
prevent it from starting by creating an area of complete block in the 
reentrant pathway. Conversely, a drug that slows conduction without 
producing  block  or  lengthening  refractoriness  significantly  can 
promote reentry. Finally, most antiarrhythmic agents share the ability 
to prolong refractoriness relative to their effects on APD; that is, the 
ratio of the effective refractory period (ERP) to APD exceeds 1.0. If a 
drug  prolongs  the  refractoriness  of  fibers  in  the  reentrant  pathway, 
the pathway may not recover excitability in time to be depolarized by 
the reentering impulse, and reentrant propagation ceases. The differ-
ent  types  of  reentry  (see  Chapter  33)  influence  the  effects  and 
effectiveness of a drug.

In considering the properties of a drug, it is important that the situ-
ation  or  model  from  which  conclusions  are  drawn  be  defined  with 
care. Electrophysiologic, hemodynamic, autonomic, pharmacokinetic, 
and adverse effects may all differ in normal subjects as compared with 
patients, in normal tissue as compared with abnormal tissue, in cardiac 
muscle as compared with specialized conduction fibers, and in atrium 
as opposed to ventricular muscle (Table 35-4).

Drug Metabolites.  Drug metabolites can add to or alter the effects 
of the parent compound by exerting similar actions, competing with 
the  parent  compound,  or  mediating  drug  toxicity.  Quinidine  has  at 
least four active metabolites but none with a potency exceeding that 
of the parent drug and none implicated in causing torsades de pointes. 
About 50% of procainamide is metabolized to N-acetylprocainamide 
(NAPA),  which  prolongs  repolarization  and  is  a  less  effective  antiar-
rhythmic drug but competes with procainamide for renotubular secre-
tory  sites  and  can  increase  the  parent  drugs  elimination  half-life. 
Lidocaines metabolite can compete with lidocaine for sodium channels 
and partially reverse block produced by lidocaine.

Pharmacogenetics.  Genetically  determined  metabolic  pathways 
account  for  many  of  the  differences  in  patients  responses  to  some 
drugs (see Chapter 9).2 The genetically determined activity of hepatic 
N-acetyltransferase regulates the development of antinuclear antibod-
ies and lupus syndrome in response to procainamide. Slow acetylator 
phenotypes  appear  to  be  more  prone  than  rapid  acetylators  to  the 
development  of  lupus.  The  enzyme  cytochrome  P-450  (CYP450)  is 
needed  to  metabolize  propafenone,  to  hydroxylate  several  beta 

blockers, and to biotransform flecainide. Lack of this enzyme (in 7% 
of patients) reduces metabolism of the parent compound and thereby 
leads  to  increased  plasma  concentrations  of  the  parent  drug  and 
reduced  concentrations  of  metabolites.  Propafenone  is  metabolized 
by CYP450 to a compound with slightly less antiarrhythmic and beta-
adrenergic blocking effects, as well as fewer central nervous system 
side effects. Thus, poor metabolizers may experience more heart rate 
slowing and neurotoxicity than extensive metabolizers do.

Drugs  such  as  rifampin,  phenobarbital,  and  phenytoin  induce  the 
synthesis of larger amounts of CYP450, which leads to lower concen-
trations of the parent drugs because of extensive metabolism, whereas 
erythromycin,  clarithromycin,  fluoxetine,  and  grapefruit  juice  inhibit 
enzyme  activity,  which  leads  to  accumulation  of  the  parent  com-
pound. Cisapride, a gastric motility agent, blocks the delayed rectifier 
current IKr but does not prolong the QT interval significantly in most 
patients  because  of  extensive  metabolism.  In  patients  who  take   
an  inhibitor  of  CYP450  (such  as  erythromycin)  along  with  cisapride, 
the  latter  drug  could  accumulate  and  lead  to  QT  prolongation  and   
torsades de pointes.

Clinical Use
In treating cardiac rhythm disorders, most drugs are given on a daily 
basis (in one to three doses) to prevent episodes from occurring or, 
in  some  cases  of  atrial  fibrillation,  to  control  the  ventricular  rate. 
Efficacy  can  be  judged  in  various  ways,  depending  on  the  clinical 
circumstances.  Symptom  reduction  (in  the  case  of  benign  arrhyth-
mias,  such  as  most  premature  ventricular  complexes  [PVCs])  and 
electrocardiographic  monitoring  (long-term  or  event;  see  Chapter 
34) are useful; electrophysiologic studies (EPSs) have been used in 
the past, with suppression of induction of electrical arrhythmia being 
the  goal.  However,  this  is  rarely  used  currently.  Interrogation  of 
implanted  device  memory  can  also  provide  an  indicator  of  the 
success of drug therapy.

In  some  patients,  tachycardia  episodes  are  infrequent  enough 
(months  between  occurrences)  and  symptoms  mild  enough  that 
reactive drug administration is more reasonable than chronic daily 
dosing.  In  this  setting  a  patient  takes  a  medication  only  after  an 
episode has started in the hope that the tachycardia will terminate in 
response to the drug and a visit to a physicians office or emergency 
department  can  be  avoided.  This  pill  in  the  pocket  strategy  has 
worked well for some patients with atrial fibrillation who have been 
given  one  of  various  medications  orally  in  a  monitored  setting  to 
ensure safety, as well as efficacy, before allowing self-medication at 
home or elsewhere.

Side Effects
Antiarrhythmic  drugs  produce  one  group  of  side  effects  related  to 
excessive dosage and plasma concentrations that result in both non-
cardiac  (e.g.,  neurologic  defects)  and  cardiac  (e.g.,  heart  failure, 
some  arrhythmias)  toxicity  and  another  group  of  side  effects  unre-
lated to plasma concentrations, which is termed idiosyncratic. Exam-
ples of the latter include amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis and 
some  arrhythmias,  such  as  quinidine-induced  torsades  de  pointes, 
which can occur in individuals with a forme fruste of long-QT syn-
drome (i.e., normal QT interval at rest but markedly prolonged inter-
val in the presence of certain medications; see Chapters 9 and 32). 
In  the  future,  it  is  likely  that  genetic  differences  will  explain  many 
idiosyncratic reactions.

Proarrhythmia
Drug-induced or drug-exacerbated cardiac arrhythmias (proarrhyth-
mia) constitute a major clinical problem. Proarrhythmia can be mani-
fested  as  an  increase  in  frequency  of  a  preexisting  arrhythmia, 
sustaining of a previously nonsustained arrhythmia (even making it 
incessant),  or  development  of  arrhythmias  that  the  patient  has  not 
previously  experienced.  Electrophysiologic  mechanisms  are  proba-
bly  related  to  prolongation  of  repolarization  or  an  increase  in  its 
transmural  dispersion,  development  of  early  afterdepolarizations 
with  resultant  torsades  de  pointes,  and  alterations  in  reentry  path-
ways  to  initiate  or  to  sustain  tachyarrhythmias  (see  Chapter  33). 
Proarrhythmic events can occur in as many as 5% to 10% of patients 
receiving  antiarrhythmic  agents.  Heart  failure  increases  this  risk.

Reduced left ventricular function, treatment with digitalis and diuret-
ics, and a longer pretreatment QT interval characterize patients who 
experience drug-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF). The more com-
monly  known  proarrhythmic  events  occur  within  several  days  of 
beginning drug therapy or changing dosage and are represented by 
such developments as incessant VT, long-QT syndrome, and torsades 
de  pointes.  However,  in  CAST  (Cardiac  Arrhythmia  Suppression 
Trial), researchers found that encainide and flecainide reduced spon-
taneous  ventricular  arrhythmias  but  were  associated  with  a  total 
mortality of 7.7%, as opposed to 3.0% in the group receiving placebo. 
Deaths  were  equally  distributed  throughout  the  treatment  period, 
thus raising the important consideration that another type of proar-
rhythmic response can occur some time after the beginning of drug 
therapy.  Such  late  proarrhythmic  effects  may  be  related  to  drug-
induced exacerbation of the regional myocardial conduction delay 
caused by ischemia and to heterogeneous drug concentrations that 
can  promote  reentry.  In  coming  years,  a  candidate  antiarrhythmic 
compounds potential for proarrhythmia may be modeled computa-
tionally or tested in stem cells.3

The  availability  of  catheter  ablation  (see  later)  and  implantable 
devices  (pacemakers  and  ICDs;  see  Chapter  36)  to  treat  a  wide 
variety of arrhythmias has largely relegated drug therapy to a second-
ary role in the treatment of serious arrhythmias. Drugs are still useful 
to  prevent  or  to  decrease  the  frequency  of  recurrences  in  patients 
who  have  relatively  infrequent  episodes  of  benign  tachycardias, 
those who have had incomplete success with catheter ablation pro-
cedures,  and  patients  with  an  ICD  to  decrease  the  frequency  of 
shocks because of supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias.

AntiarrhythmicAgents
Class IA Agents
Quinidine
Quinidine and quinine are isomeric alkaloids isolated from cinchona 
bark.4  Although  quinidine  shares  the  antimalarial,  antipyretic,  and 
vagolytic  actions  of  quinine,  only  quinidine  has  electrophysiologic 
effects. It blocks several channels (rapid inward sodium channel, IKr, 
Ito, and to a lesser extent, the slow inward calcium channel, IKs, and 
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium current [KATP]).

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Quinidine exerts little effect on auto-
maticity  of  the  normal  sinus  node  but  suppresses  automaticity  in 
normal  Purkinje  fibers  (Table  35-5;  see  also  Tables  35-1,  35-2,  and 
35-3).  In  patients  with  sick  sinus  syndrome,  quinidine  can  depress 
sinus node automaticity. Quinidine produces early afterdepolarizations 
in experimental preparations and in humans, which may be respon-
sible for torsades de pointes. Because of its significant anticholinergic 
effect  and  the  reflex  sympathetic  stimulation  resulting  from  alpha-
adrenergic blockade, which causes peripheral vasodilation, quinidine 
can reflexly increase the sinus node discharge rate and improve atrio-
ventricular (AV) nodal conduction. Quinidine prolongs repolarization, 
an  effect  that  is  more  prominent  at  slow  heart  rates  (reverse  use 
dependence) because of block of IKr (as well as enhancing the late Na 
current). Faster rates result in more block of sodium channels and less 
unblocking because of a smaller percentage of time spent in a polar-
ized state (use dependence). Isoproterenol can modulate the effects 
of quinidine on reentrant circuits in humans. Quinidine at higher doses 
inhibits the late Na current. As noted, quinidine blocks the transient 
outward current Ito, which is probably why it is effective in suppressing 
ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (see Chapter 9).

Hemodynamic Effects.  Quinidine induces vasodilation by block-
ing alpha-adrenergic receptors and can cause significant hypotension. 
It does not result in significant direct myocardial depression.

Pharmacokinetics.  Plasma  quinidine  concentrations  peak  at 
approximately 3 to 4 hours after an oral dose of a quinidine gluconate 
preparation (see Table 35-4). Quinidine can be given intravenously if 
it  is  infused  slowly,  but  intramuscular  dosing  should  be  avoided. 
Approximately 80% of plasma quinidine is protein bound, especially 
to  alpha1-acid  glycoprotein.  Both  the  liver  and  the  kidneys  remove 
quinidine;  dose  adjustments  may  be  made  to  achieve  appropriate 
serum concentrations. Its elimination half-life is 5 to 8 hours after oral 
administration.  Quinidines  effect  on  repolarization  and  its  overall 
efficacy vary directly with left ventricular function; at the same serum 
concentration, the QT interval is longer in women than in men.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.  The usual oral dose of quini-
dine  sulfate  for  an  adult  is  300  to  600 mg  four  times  daily,  which 
results in a steady-state level within about 24 hours (see Table 35-4). 
A loading dose of 600 to 1000 mg produces an earlier effective con-
centration.  Oral  doses  of  the  gluconate  are  about  30%  higher  than 
those of the sulfate. Important interactions with other drugs occur.

INDICATIONS.  Quinidine is a versatile antiarrhythmic agent that 
was used previously to treat premature supraventricular and ventricu-
lar complexes and sustained tachyarrhythmias. However, because of 
its side effect profile and potential for causing torsades de pointes, as 
well as its limited usefulness in preventing VT and VF in most applica-
tions, its use has decreased greatly. In recent years, however, there 
has been an increase in interest in quinidine for treating primary VF, 
ventricular  arrhythmias  in  patients  with  Brugada  syndrome5  (see 
Chapter  32),  and  short-QT  syndrome.6  Because  it  crosses  the  pla-
centa, quinidine can be used to treat arrhythmias in the fetus.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  The  most  common  adverse  effects  of  chronic 
oral quinidine therapy are gastrointestinal and include nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea,  abdominal  pain,  and  anorexia  (milder  with  the  gluconate 
form).  Central  nervous  system  toxicity  includes  tinnitus,  hearing  loss, 
visual  disturbances,  confusion,  delirium,  and  psychosis  (cinchonism). 
Allergic reactions include rash, fever, immune-mediated thrombocyto-
penia, hemolytic anemia, and rarely, anaphylaxis. Side effects may pre-
clude long-term administration of quinidine in 30% to 40% of patients.

Quinidine can slow cardiac conduction, sometimes to the point of 
block, which is manifested as prolongation of the QRS duration or as 
sinoatrial  or  AV  nodal  conduction  disturbances.  Quinidine  can 
produce syncope in 0.5% to 2.0% of patients, most often the result of 
a self-terminating episode of torsades de pointes. Quinidine prolongs 
the  QT  interval  in  most  patients,  regardless  of  whether  ventricular 
arrhythmias  occur,  but  significant  QT  prolongation  (QT  interval  of 
500  to  600  milliseconds)  is  often  a  characteristic  of  patients  with 
quinidine-related  syncope,  who  may  have  a  genetic  predisposition 
underlying such a response (see Chapter 9). Many of these patients 
are also receiving digitalis or diuretics or have hypokalemia; women 
are more susceptible than men. Importantly, syncope is unrelated to 
plasma  concentrations  of  quinidine  or  the  duration  of  therapy, 
although most episodes occur within the first 2 to 4 days of therapy, 
often  after  conversion  of  atrial  fibrillation  to  sinus  rhythm  (for  this 
reason  the  drug  should  not  be  taken  on  an  intermittent  basis). 
Therapy requires immediate discontinuation of use of the drug and 
avoidance  of  other  drugs  that  have  similar  pharmacologic  effects 
because  cross-sensitivity  exists  in  some  patients.  Magnesium  given 
intravenously  (2 g  over  a  period  of  1  to  2  minutes,  followed  by  an 
infusion  of  3  to  20 mg/min)  is  the  initial  drug  treatment  of  choice. 
Atrial or ventricular pacing can be used to suppress the ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia, perhaps by suppressing early afterdepolarizations. 
When  pacing  is  not  available,  isoproterenol  can  be  given  with 
caution. The arrhythmia gradually dissipates as quinidine is cleared 
and the QT interval returns to baseline.

Drugs that induce hepatic enzyme production, such as phenobar-
bital and phenytoin, can shorten the duration of action of quinidine 
by increasing its rate of elimination. Quinidine can increase plasma 
concentrations of flecainide by inhibiting the CYP450 enzyme system. 
Quinidine may elevate serum digoxin concentrations by decreasing 
its  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  and  the  affinity  of  tissue 
receptors.

Procainamide

Electrophysiologic Actions.  The cardiac actions of procainamide 
on automaticity, conduction, excitability, and membrane responsive-
ness  resemble  those  of  quinidine  (see  Tables  35-1,  35-2,  35-3,  and 
35-5). Procainamide predominantly blocks the inactivated state of INa. 
It  also  blocks  IKr  and  IK.ATP.  Like  quinidine,  procainamide  usually  pro-
longs the ERP more than it prolongs the APD and thus may prevent 
reentry. Procainamide exerts the least anticholinergic effects among 
type IA drugs. It does not affect normal sinus node automaticity. In 
vitro, procainamide decreases abnormal automaticity, with less effect 
on triggered activity or catecholamine-enhanced normal automaticity. 
The electrophysiologic effects of NAPA, the major metabolite of pro-
cainamide,  differ  from  those  of  the  parent  compound.  NAPA,  a  K+

channel blocker (IKr), exerts a class III action and prolongs the APD of 
ventricular  muscle  and  Purkinje  fibers  in  a  dose-dependent  manner. 
High levels can produce early afterdepolarizations, triggered activity, 
and torsades de pointes.

Hemodynamic  Effects.  Procainamide  can  depress  myocardial 
contractility in high concentrations. It does not produce alpha block-
ade  but  can  result  in  peripheral  vasodilation,  possibly  through  anti-
sympathetic  effects  on  the  brain  or  spinal  cord,  which  can  impair 
cardiovascular reflexes.

Pharmacokinetics.  Oral  administration  produces  a  peak  plasma 
concentration in around 1 hour. Approximately 80% of oral procain-
amide is bioavailable; the overall elimination half-life of procainamide 
is 3 to 5 hours, with 50% to 60% of the drug being eliminated by 
the kidneys and 10% to 30% by hepatic metabolism (see Table 35-4). 
The drug is acetylated to NAPA, which is excreted almost exclusively 
by the kidneys. As renal function decreases and in patients with heart 
failure, NAPA levels increase and, because of the risk for serious car-
diotoxicity, need to be carefully monitored in these situations. NAPA 
has an elimination half-life of 7 to 8 hours, but the half-life exceeds 
10 hours if high doses of procainamide are used. Increased age, con-
gestive heart failure, and reduced creatinine clearance lower the clear-
ance of procainamide and necessitate a reduced dosage.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.  Procainamide can be given by 
the oral, intravenous, or intramuscular route to achieve plasma con-
centrations in the range of 4 to 10 mg/mL and produce an antiarrhyth-
mic effect (see Table 35-4). Several intravenous regimens have been 
used to administer procainamide; 25 to 50 mg can be given during a 
1-minute period and then repeated every 5 minutes until the arrhyth-
mia has been controlled, hypotension results, or the QRS complex is 
prolonged more than 50%. Doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg administered a rate 
of at 50 mg/min can also be used. With this method, the plasma con-
centration  falls  rapidly  during  the  first  15  minutes  after  the  loading 
dose,  with  parallel  effects  on  refractoriness  and  conduction.  A 

constant-rate intravenous infusion of procainamide can be given at a 
dosage of 2 to 6 mg/min, depending on the patients response.

Oral administration of procainamide requires a 3- to 4-hour dosing 
interval at a total daily dose of 2 to 6 g, with a steady-state concentra-
tion  being  reached  within  1  day.  When  a  loading  dose  is  used,  it 
should be twice the maintenance dose. Frequent dosing is required 
because of its short elimination half-life in normal subjects. For the 
extended-release  forms  of  procainamide,  dosing  is  at  6-  to  12-hour 
intervals.  Procainamide  is  well  absorbed  after  intramuscular  injec-
tion, with almost 100% of the dose bioavailable.

INDICATIONS.  Procainamide is used to treat both supraventricu-
lar  and  ventricular  arrhythmias  in  a  manner  comparable  to  that  of 
quinidine.  Although  both  drugs  have  similar  electrophysiologic 
actions,  either  drug  can  effectively  suppress  a  supraventricular  or 
ventricular  arrhythmia  that  is  resistant  to  the  other  drug.  Procain-
amide can be used to convert recent-onset atrial fibrillation to sinus 
rhythm.  As  with  quinidine,  prior  treatment  with  beta  or  calcium 
channel  blockers  is  recommended  to  prevent  acceleration  of  the 
ventricular response during atrial flutter or fibrillation after procain-
amide therapy. Procainamide can block conduction in the accessory 
pathway  of  patients  with  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome  and  can 
be  used  in  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation  and  a  rapid  ventricular 
response  related  to  conduction  over  the  accessory  pathway.  It  can 
produce His-Purkinje block (see Fig. 34-8) and is sometimes admin-
istered during an EPS to stress the His-Purkinje system and evaluate 
the need for a pacemaker. However, it should be used with caution 
in  patients  with  evidence  of  His-Purkinje  disease  (bundle  branch 
block)  in  whom  a  ventricular  pacemaker  is  not  readily  available. 
Procainamide is more effective than lidocaine in acutely terminating 
sustained  VT.  Most  consistently,  procainamide  slows  the  VT  rate,  a 
change correlated with the increase in QRS duration. The drug also 
has diagnostic application when given intravenously (10 mg/kg over

a  5-  to  10-minute  period).  In  patients  with  suspected  Brugada  syn-
drome  who  have  normal  findings  on  a  resting  electrocardiogram 
(ECG), drug infusion may result in the characteristic Brugada sign, 
whereas in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the drug 
may  cause  sudden  loss  of  preexcitation,  a  finding  indicative  of  an 
accessory pathway with a long refractory period and suggesting low 
risk for a dangerously rapid ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. 
Evidence for the latter point is mixed, however.

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  Noncardiac adverse effects from administra-
tion  of  procainamide  include  rash,  myalgia,  digital  vasculitis,  and 
Raynaud phenomenon. Fever and agranulocytosis may be the result 
of hypersensitivity reactions, and the white blood cell and differential 
counts should be assessed at regular intervals. Gastrointestinal side 
effects  are  less  frequent  than  with  quinidine,  and  adverse  central 
nervous  system  side  effects  are  less  frequent  than  with  lidocaine. 
Toxic concentrations of procainamide can diminish myocardial per-
formance  and  promote  hypotension.  Various  conduction  distur-
bances  or  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  that  are  similar  to  those 
produced by quinidine can occur. NAPA can cause QT prolongation 
and torsades de pointes. In the absence of sinus node disease, pro-
cainamide does not adversely affect sinus node function. In patients 
with  sinus  node  dysfunction,  however,  procainamide  can  prolong 
sinus  node  recovery  time  and  worsen  symptoms  in  some  patients 
with bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome.

Arthralgia,  fever,  pleuropericarditis,  hepatomegaly,  and  hemor-
rhagic pericardial effusion with tamponade have been described in 
a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome related to pro-
cainamide  administration.  The  syndrome  occurs  more  frequently 
and earlier in patients who are slow acetylators of procainamide and 
is genetically influenced (see Chapter 9). Acetylation of an aromatic 
amino  group  on  procainamide  to  form  NAPA  appears  to  block  the 
SLE-inducing effect. In 60% to 70% of patients who take procainamide 
on  a  chronic  basis,  antinuclear  antibodies  develop,  with  clinical 
symptoms occurring in 20% to 30%, but this is reversible when use of 
procainamide is stopped. Positive serologic test results are not neces-
sarily  a  reason  to  discontinue  drug  therapy;  however,  the  develop-
ment of symptoms or a positive anti-DNA antibody indicates that drug 
therapy  should  be  discontinued.  Corticosteroid  administration  in 
these  patients  may  eliminate  the  symptoms.  In  this  syndrome,  in 
contrast to naturally occurring SLE, the brain and kidneys are spared, 
and there is no predilection for women.

insufficiency prolongs its elimination time. Thus, in patients with renal, 
hepatic, or cardiac insufficiency, loading and maintenance doses need 
to be reduced. Peak blood levels after oral administration occur in 1 
to 2 hours. Approximately 50% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged 
in  urine,  with  around  30%  occurring  as  the  mono-N-dealkylated 
metabolite.  The  metabolites  appear  to  exert  less  effect  than  the 
parent compound does. Erythromycin inhibits its metabolism.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  Doses  are  generally  100  to 
200 mg orally every 6 hours, with a range of 400 to 1200 mg/day (see 
Table 35-4). A controlled-release preparation can be given as 200 to 
300 mg every 12 hours.

INDICATIONS.  Disopyramide appears to be comparable to quini-
dine and procainamide in reducing the frequency of PVCs and effec-
tively preventing recurrence of VT in selected patients. Disopyramide 
has  been  combined  with  other  drugs,  such  as  mexiletine,  to  treat 
patients who do not respond or respond only partially to one drug.

Disopyramide  helps  prevent  recurrence  of  atrial  fibrillation  after 
successful  cardioversion  as  effectively  as  quinidine  does  and  may 
terminate atrial flutter. In treating patients with atrial fibrillation, par-
ticularly atrial flutter, the ventricular rate must be controlled before 
disopyramide is administered, or the combination of a decrease in 
atrial rate with vagolytic effects on the AV node can result in 1 : 1 AV 
conduction during atrial flutter (see Chapter 38). Disopyramide may 
be useful in preventing episodes of neurally mediated syncope. It has 
been used in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  Three  types  of  adverse  effects  follow  diso-
pyramide administration. The most common effects are related to the 
drugs potent parasympatholytic properties and include urinary hesi-
tancy  or  retention,  constipation,  blurred  vision,  closed-angle  glau-
coma, and dry mouth. Symptoms are less with the sustained-release 
form.  Second,  disopyramide  can  produce  ventricular  tachyarrhyth-
mias  that  are  commonly  associated  with  QT  prolongation  and  
torsades de pointes. Cross-sensitization to both quinidine and diso-
pyramide  occurs  in  some  patients,  and  torsades  de  pointes  can 
develop while receiving either drug. When drug-induced torsades de 
pointes occurs, agents that prolong the QT interval should be used 
cautiously or not at all. Finally, disopyramide can reduce contractility 
of the normal ventricle, but the depression of ventricular function is 
much  more  pronounced  in  patients  with  preexisting  ventricular 
failure. Rarely, cardiovascular collapse can result.

Disopyramide
Disopyramide has been approved in the United States for oral admin-
istration  to  treat  patients  with  ventricular  and  supraventricular 
arrhythmias.

Ajmaline
Ajmaline, a rauwolfia derivative, has been used extensively to treat 
patients with ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias in Europe 
and Asia but is not available in the United States.

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Although  it  is  structurally  different 
from quinidine and procainamide, disopyramide produces similar elec-
trophysiologic effects; it causes use-dependent block of INa and non
use-dependent  block  of  IKr  (see  Tables  35-1,  35-2,  35-3,  and  35-5). 
Disopyramide also inhibits IK.ATP; it does not affect calcium-dependent 
action potentials, except possibly at very high concentrations.

Disopyramide  is  a  muscarinic  blocker  and  can  increase  the  sinus 
node  discharge  rate  and  shorten  AV  nodal  conduction  time  and 
refractoriness when the nodes are under cholinergic (vagal) influence. 
Disopyramide can also slow the sinus node discharge rate by a direct 
action when given in high concentration and can significantly depress 
sinus node activity in patients with sinus node dysfunction. It exerts 
greater  anticholinergic  effects  than  quinidine  does  and  does  not 
appear to affect alpha or beta adrenoceptors. The drug prolongs atrial 
and ventricular refractory periods, but its effect on AV nodal conduc-
tion and refractoriness is not consistent. Disopyramide prolongs His-
Purkinje conduction time, but infra-His block rarely occurs. It can be 
administered  safely  to  patients  who  have  first-degree  AV  delay  and 
narrow QRS complexes.

Hemodynamic Effects.  Disopyramide suppresses ventricular sys-
tolic performance and is a mild arterial vasodilator. The drug should 
generally be avoided in patients with reduced left ventricular systolic 
function because they tolerate its negative inotropic effects poorly.

Pharmacokinetics.  Disopyramide is 80% to 90% absorbed, with 
a mean elimination half-life of 8 to 9 hours in healthy volunteers but 
almost 10 hours in patients with heart failure (see Table 35-4). Renal 

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Like other type IA drugs, ajmaline pro-
duces  use-dependent  block  of  INa;  it  also  weakly  blocks  IKr.  The  drug 
has mild anticholinergic activity (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5).
Hemodynamic  Effects.  Ajmaline  mildly  suppresses  ventricular 
systolic performance but does not affect peripheral resistance. It also 
inhibits platelet activity more potently than aspirin does.

Pharmacokinetics,  Dosage,  and  Administration.  Ajmaline  is 
well absorbed with a mean elimination half-life of 13 minutes in most 
patients, thus making it poorly suited to long-term oral use. The dose 
for termination of acute arrhythmia is generally 50 mg intravenously 
infused over a period of 1 to 2 minutes (see Table 35-4).

Indications.  Although it is useful for terminating SVTs by intrave-
nous infusion, other medications have largely supplanted ajmaline for 
this purpose. The drugs use has evolved to that of a diagnostic tool. 
When administered intravenously at doses of 50 mg over a 3-minute 
period, or 10 mg/min, to a total dose of 1 mg/kg, ajmaline can have 
the  following  effects:  (1)  delta  wave  disappearance  in  patients  with 
Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome  (indicating  an  accessory  pathway 
anterograde ERP longer than 250 milliseconds); (2) ST-T abnormalities 
and interventricular conduction blocks in patients with occult chagasic 
cardiomyopathy; (3) heart block in patients with bundle branch block 
and syncope, but in whom no rhythm disturbance had been discov-
ered; and (4) right precordial ST elevation in patients with suspected 
Brugada syndrome in whom findings on the resting ECG are normal. 
It is in this last setting that ajmaline is used most frequently.

Adverse  Effects.  Ajmaline  can  produce  mild  anticholinergic  side 
effects, as well as mild depression of left ventricular systolic function, 
and can worsen AV conduction in patients with His-Purkinje disease. 
Rare occurrences of torsades de pointes have been reported. Ajmaline 
can cause an increase in the defibrillation threshold.

Class IB Agents
Lidocaine

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Lidocaine  blocks  INa,  predominantly 
in the open or possibly inactivated state. It has rapid onset and offset 
kinetics and does not affect normal sinus node automaticity in usual 
doses but does depress other normal and abnormal forms of automa-
ticity, as well as early and late afterdepolarizations in Purkinje fibers 
in vitro (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5). Lidocaine has only a 
modest depressant effect on  (cid:31)Vmax; however, faster rates of stimula-
tion,  reduced  pH,  increased  extracellular  K+  concentration,  and 
reduced membrane potential (changes that can result from ischemia) 
increase  the  ability  of  lidocaine  to  block  INa.  Lidocaine  can  convert 
areas of unidirectional block into bidirectional block during ischemia 
and  inhibit  the  development  of  VF  by  preventing  fragmentation  of 
organized large wave fronts into heterogeneous wavelets.

Except in very high concentrations, lidocaine does not affect slow-
channeldependent  action  potentials  despite  its  moderate  suppres-
sion  of  the  slow  inward  current.  Lidocaine  has  little  effect  on  atrial 
fibers  and  does  not  affect  conduction  in  accessory  pathways. 
Depressed  automaticity  or  conduction  can  develop  in  patients  with 
preexisting  sinus  node  dysfunction,  abnormal  His-Purkinje  conduc-
tion,  or  junctional  or  ventricular  escape  rhythms.  Part  of  its  effects 
may involve inhibition of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity.

Hemodynamic  Effects.  Clinically  significant  adverse  hemody-
namic effects are rarely noted at the usual drug concentrations unless 
left ventricular function is severely impaired.

Pharmacokinetics.  Lidocaine  is  used  only  parenterally  because 
oral administration results in extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism 
and unpredictable low plasma levels, as well as excessive metabolites 
that  can  produce  toxicity  (see  Table  35-4).  Hepatic  metabolism  of 
lidocaine  depends  on  hepatic  blood  flow;  severe  hepatic  disease  or 
reduced hepatic blood flow, as in heart failure or shock, can markedly 
decrease the rate of lidocaine metabolism. Beta adrenoceptor blockers 
can decrease hepatic blood flow and increase the serum concentration 
of  lidocaine.  Prolonged  infusion  can  reduce  lidocaine  clearance.  Its 
elimination half-life averages 1 to 2 hours in normal subjects, longer 
than  4  hours  in  patients  after  uncomplicated  myocardial  infarction, 
longer than 10 hours in patients after myocardial infarction compli-
cated by heart failure, and even longer in the presence of cardiogenic 
shock. Maintenance doses should be reduced by a third to a half in 
patients with low cardiac output. Lidocaine is 50% to 80% protein 
bound.

although  amiodarone  has  been  shown  to  yield  higher  rates  of  sur-
vival, at least to hospital admission.

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  The most commonly reported adverse effects 
of  lidocaine  are  dose-related  manifestations  of  central  nervous 
system toxicity: dizziness, paresthesias, confusion, delirium, stupor, 
coma,  and  seizures.  Occasional  sinus  node  depression  and  His-
Purkinje  block  have  been  reported.  Rarely,  lidocaine  can  cause 
malignant hyperthermia.

Mexiletine
Mexiletine, a local anesthetic congener of lidocaine with anticonvul-
sant properties, is used for the oral treatment of patients with symp-
tomatic ventricular arrhythmias.

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Mexiletine  is  similar  to  lidocaine  in 
many of its electrophysiologic actions. In vitro, mexiletine shortens the 
APD and ERP of Purkinje fibers and, to a lesser extent, ventricular muscle. 
It depresses the  (cid:31)Vmax of phase 0 by blocking INa, especially at faster 
rates, and depresses the automaticity of Purkinje fibers but not of the 
normal sinus node. Its onset and offset kinetics are rapid. Hypoxia or 
ischemia can increase its effects (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5).
Mexiletine can result in severe bradycardia and abnormal sinus node 
recovery  time  in  patients  with  sinus  node  disease,  but  not  in  those 
with a normal sinus node. It does not affect AV nodal conduction and 
can depress His-Purkinje conduction, but not greatly, unless conduc-
tion  was  abnormal  initially.  Mexiletine  does  not  appear  to  affect 
human  atrial  muscle.  It  does  not  affect  the  QT  interval.  It  has  been 
used in treating a variety of other disorders, including erythromelalgia 
(red, painful extremities) in children and myotonia.

Hemodynamic Effects.  Mexiletine exerts no major hemodynamic 
effects on ventricular contractile performance or peripheral resistance.
Pharmacokinetics.  Mexiletine  is  rapidly  and  almost  completely 
absorbed  after  oral  ingestion  by  volunteers,  with  peak  plasma  con-
centrations being attained in 2 to 4 hours (see Table 35-4). Its elimina-
tion half-life is approximately 10 hours in healthy subjects but 17 hours 
in  patients  after  myocardial  infarction.  Therapeutic  plasma  levels  of 
0.5 to 2 mg/mL are maintained by oral doses of 200 to 300 mg every 
6 to 8 hours. Absorption with less than a 10% first-pass hepatic effect 
occurs  in  the  upper  part  of  the  small  intestine  and  is  delayed  and 
incomplete in patients receiving narcotics or antacids. Approximately 
70% of the drug is protein bound. The apparent volume of distribu-
tion is large because of extensive tissue uptake. Normally, mexiletine 
is  eliminated  metabolically  by  the  liver,  with  less  than  10%  being 
excreted  unchanged  in  urine.  Doses  should  be  reduced  in  patients 
with cirrhosis or left ventricular failure. Renal clearance of mexiletine 
decreases  as  urinary  pH  increases.  Its  known  metabolites  exert  no 
electrophysiologic effects. Metabolism can be increased by phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, and rifampin and can be reduced by cimetidine.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  Although  lidocaine  can  be 
given intramuscularly, the intravenous route is most commonly used, 
with an initial bolus of 1 to 2 mg/kg body weight at a rate of 20 to 50 mg/
min and a second injection of half the initial dose 20 to 40 minutes later 
to maintain the therapeutic concentration (see Table 35-4).

If the initial bolus of lidocaine is ineffective, up to two more boluses 
of 1 mg/kg may be administered at 5-minute intervals. Patients who 
require  more  than  one  bolus  to  achieve  a  therapeutic  effect  have 
arrhythmias that respond only to higher lidocaine plasma concentra-
tions, and a higher maintenance dose may be necessary to sustain 
these higher concentrations. Maintenance infusion rates in the range 
of 1 to 4 mg/min produce steady-state plasma levels of 1 to 5 mg/mL 
in patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction, but these rates 
must be reduced during heart failure or shock because of the con-
comitant  reduced  hepatic  blood  flow.  Higher  doses  are  unlikely  to 
provide additional benefit but do increase the risk for toxicity.

INDICATIONS.  Lidocaine has moderate efficacy against ventricu-
lar  arrhythmias  of  diverse  causes;  it  is  generally  ineffective  against 
supraventricular  arrhythmias  and  rarely  terminates  monomorphic 
VT. Although once commonly used in an attempt to prevent VF in the 
first  2  days  after  acute  myocardial  infarction,  its  efficacy  was  not 
great, and because it can produce side effects and a possible increase 
in  the  risk  for  the  development  of  asystole,  such  use  is  not  recom-
mended.  Lidocaine  has  been  effective  in  patients  after  coronary 
revascularization and in those resuscitated from out-of-hospital VF, 

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  The  recommended  starting 
dose is 200 mg orally every 8 hours when rapid arrhythmia control 
is not essential (see Table 35-4). Doses may be increased or decreased 
by 50 to 100 mg every 2 to 3 days and are better tolerated when given 
with food. The total daily dose should not exceed 1200 mg. In some 
patients, administration every 12 hours can be effective.

INDICATIONS.  Mexiletine is a moderately effective antiarrhythmic 
agent for the treatment of acute and chronic ventricular tachyarrhyth-
mias, but not SVTs. Success rates vary from 6% to 60% and can be 
increased in some patients if mexiletine is combined with other drugs 
such  as  procainamide,  beta  blockers,  quinidine,  disopyramide, 
propafenone, or amiodarone. Most studies show no clear superiority 
of mexiletine over other class I agents. Mexiletine may be very useful 
in  children  with  congenital  heart  disease  and  serious  ventricular 
arrhythmias. In treating patients with a long QT interval, mexiletine 
may be safer than drugs that increase the QT interval further, such 
as  quinidine.  Limited  experience  in  treating  subsets  of  patients  
with long-QT syndrome (LQT3, which is related to the SCN5A gene 
for  the  cardiac  sodium  channel)  suggests  a  beneficial  role  (see 
Chapter 32).

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  Up to 40% of patients may require a change 
in dose or discontinuation of mexiletine therapy as a result of adverse 
effects, including tremor, dysarthria, dizziness, paresthesia, diplopia, 
nystagmus, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. Cardiovas-
cular side effects are rare but include hypotension, bradycardia, and

exacerbation of arrhythmia. The adverse effects of mexiletine appear 
to be dose related, and toxic effects occur at plasma concentrations 
only slightly higher than therapeutic levels. Therefore, effective use 
of  this  antiarrhythmic  drug  requires  careful  titration  of  dose  and 
monitoring of plasma concentration. Lidocaine should be avoided or 
the dose reduced in patients receiving mexiletine.

Class IC Agents
Flecainide
Flecainide  is  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration 
(FDA) to treat patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, 
as well as various supraventricular arrhythmias.

Phenytoin

Phenytoin was used originally to treat seizure disorders. Its value as 
an antiarrhythmic agent remains limited.

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Phenytoin  effectively  abolishes 
abnormal automaticity caused by digitalis-induced delayed afterdepo-
larizations  in  cardiac  Purkinje  fibers  and  suppresses  certain  digitalis-
induced  arrhythmias  in  humans  (see  Tables  35-1,  35-2,  35-3,  and 
35-5).  The  rate  of  rise  of  action  potentials  initiated  early  in  the   
relative refractory period is increased, as is membrane responsiveness, 
which possibly reduces the chance of impaired conduction and block. 
Phenytoin minimally affects the sinus discharge rate and AV conduc-
tion in humans. Some of phenytoins antiarrhythmic effects may be 
neurally  mediated  because  it  can  modulate  both  sympathetic  and 
vagal efferent activity. It has no peripheral cholinergic- or beta-adren-
ergic blocking actions and minimal hemodynamic effect.

Pharmacokinetics.  The pharmacokinetics of phenytoin is less than 
ideal.  Absorption  after  oral  administration  is  incomplete  and  varies 
with  the  brand  of  drug.  Plasma  concentrations  peak  8  to  12  hours 
after an oral dose; 90% of the drug is protein bound (see Table 35-4). 
Phenytoin has limited solubility at physiologic pH, and intramuscular 
administration  is  associated  with  pain,  muscle  necrosis,  sterile 
abscesses, and variable absorption. Therapeutic serum concentrations 
of phenytoin (10 to 20 mg/mL) are similar for the treatment of cardiac 
arrhythmias and epilepsy. Lower concentrations can suppress certain 
digitalis-induced arrhythmias.

Metabolism.  More than 90% of a dose is hydroxylated in the liver 
to  inactive  compounds;  significant  genetically  determined  variation 
can occur. The elimination half-time of phenytoin is approximately 24 
hours and can be slowed in the presence of liver disease or when it 
is administered concomitantly with drugs such as warfarin, isoniazid, 
and  phenothiazines,  which  compete  with  phenytoin  for  hepatic 
enzymes.  Because  of  the  large  number  of  medications  that  can 
increase  or  decrease  phenytoin  levels  during  chronic  therapy,  the 
plasma concentration of phenytoin should be determined frequently 
when changes are made in other medications. Phenytoin has concen-
tration-dependent kinetics for elimination that can cause unexpected 
toxicity because disproportionately large changes in plasma concen-
tration can follow dose increases.
Dosage and Administration
To  achieve  a  therapeutic  plasma  concentration  rapidly,  100 mg  of 
phenytoin should be administered intravenously every 5 minutes until 
the arrhythmia is controlled, 1 g has been given, or adverse side effects 
result (see Table 35-4). In general, if phenytoin is going to control the 
arrhythmia, 700 to 1000 mg suffices. A large central vein should be 
used to avoid pain and the development of phlebitis produced by the 
drugs alkalotic vehicle. Orally, phenytoin is given as a loading dose 
of 1000 mg the first day, 500 mg on the second and third days, and 
300 to 400 mg daily thereafter. Maintenance doses can generally be 
given once daily because of the long half-life of elimination.

Indications
Phenytoin has been used successfully to treat atrial and ventricular 
arrhythmias caused by digitalis toxicity but is much less effective in 
treating  ventricular  arrhythmias  in  patients  with  ischemic  heart 
disease or with atrial arrhythmias not caused by digitalis toxicity.

Adverse Effects
The  most  common  manifestations  of  phenytoin  toxicity  are  central 
nervous  system  effects  (nystagmus,  ataxia,  drowsiness,  stupor,  and 
coma)  and  correlate  with  increases  in  plasma  drug  concentration. 
Nausea,  epigastric  pain,  and  anorexia  are  also  relatively  common 
effects of phenytoin. Long-term administration can result in hypergly-
cemia, hypocalcemia, rash, megaloblastic anemia, gingival hypertro-
phy,  lymph  node  hyperplasia  (a  syndrome  resembling  malignant 
lymphoma),  peripheral  neuropathy,  pneumonitis,  and  drug- 
induced SLE.

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Flecainide  exhibits  marked  use-
dependent depressant effects on the rapid sodium channel by decreas-
ing  (cid:31)Vmax  and  has  slow  onset  and  offset  kinetics  (see  Tables  35-1, 
35-2, 35-3, and 35-5). Drug dissociation from the sodium channel is 
slow, with time constants of 10 to 30 seconds (versus 4 to 8 seconds 
for quinidine and less than 1 second for lidocaine). Thus, marked drug 
effects  can  occur  at  physiologic  heart  rates.  Flecainide  shortens  the 
duration of the Purkinje fiber action potential but prolongs it in ven-
tricular  muscle,  actions  that  depending  on  the  circumstances,  could 
enhance  or  reduce  electrical  heterogeneity  and  create  or  suppress 
arrhythmias.  Flecainide  profoundly  slows  conduction  in  all  cardiac 
fibers and, in high concentrations, inhibits the slow Ca2+ channel (see 
Chapter 33). Conduction time in the atria, ventricles, AV node, and 
His-Purkinje  system  is  prolonged.  Minimal  increases  in  atrial  or  ven-
tricular  refractoriness  or  in  the  QT  interval  result.  Anterograde  and 
retrograde  refractoriness  in  accessory  pathways  can  increase  signifi-
cantly  in  a  use-dependent  fashion.  Sinus  node  function  remains 
unchanged in normal subjects but may be depressed in patients with 
sinus node dysfunction. Flecainide can facilitate or inhibit reentry and 
may  transform  atrial  fibrillation  to  flutter.  Pacing  and  defibrillation 
thresholds are characteristically slightly to significantly increased.

Hemodynamic  Effects.  Flecainide  depresses  cardiac  perfor-
mance, particularly in patients with compromised ventricular systolic 
function,  and  should  be  used  cautiously  or  not  at  all  in  those  with 
moderate or severe ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Pharmacokinetics.  Flecainide is at least 90% absorbed, with peak 
plasma concentrations being achieved in 3 to 4 hours. Its elimination 
half-life in patients with ventricular arrhythmias is 20 hours, with 85% 
of the drug being excreted unchanged or as an inactive metabolite in 
urine  (see  Table  35-4).  Its  two  major  metabolites  have  less  potency 
than  the  parent  drug.  Elimination  is  slower  in  patients  with  renal 
disease and heart failure, and doses should be reduced in these situ-
ations. Therapeutic plasma concentrations range from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/
mL.  Approximately  40%  of  the  drug  is  protein  bound.  Increases  in 
serum concentrations of digoxin (15% to 25%) and propranolol (30%) 
result during coadministration with flecainide. Propranolol, quinidine, 
and  amiodarone  may  increase  flecainide  serum  concentrations.  Five 
to 7 days of dosing may be required to reach a steady-state concentra-
tion in some patients.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  The  starting  dose  is  100 mg 
every  12  hours,  increased  in  increments  of  50 mg  twice  daily,  no 
sooner than every 3 to 4 days, until efficacy is achieved or an adverse 
effect  is  noted  or  to  a  maximum  of  400 mg/day  (see  Table  35-4). 
Cardiac rhythm and QRS duration should be monitored after changes 
in dose.

INDICATIONS.  Flecainide  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  life-
threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, SVTs, and paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation. Encouraging experimental and early clinical data support 
its  use  for  catecholaminergic  polymorphic  VT  (see  Chapter  32). 
Some experts have suggested that therapy should begin in the hospital 
while the ECG is being monitored because of the possibility of proar-
rhythmic  events  (see  later).  The  dosage  is  adjusted  to  achieve  the 
desired effect, but the serum concentration should not exceed 1.0 mg/
mL. Flecainide is particularly effective in almost totally suppressing 
PVCs and short runs of nonsustained VT. As with other class I antiar-
rhythmic drugs, no data from controlled studies indicate that the drug 
favorably  affects  survival  or  sudden  cardiac  death,  and  data  from 
CAST  have  indicated  increased  mortality  in  patients  with  coronary 
artery disease. Flecainide produces a use-dependent prolongation of 
VT  cycle  length,  which  can  improve  hemodynamic  tolerance.  Fle-
cainide is also useful for various SVTs, such as atrial tachycardia (AT), 
flutter, and atrial fibrillation (including oral loading to terminate epi-
sodes acutely). When it is administered chronically, isoproterenol can 
reverse some of these effects. It is important to slow the ventricular rate 
before treatment of atrial fibrillation with flecainide to avoid the 1 : 1 
AV conduction of slowed atrial flutter that may result from the effect of 
flecainide  on  fibrillation.  Flecainide  has  been  used  to  treat  fetal

arrhythmias and arrhythmias in children. Flecainide administration 
can produce ST elevation in lead V1, characteristic of Brugada syn-
drome, in susceptible patients (see Chapter 32) and has been used as 
a diagnostic tool in persons suspected of having this disorder.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  Proarrhythmic effects are some of the most 
important adverse effects of flecainide. Its marked slowing of conduc-
tion  precludes  its  use  in  patients  with  second-degree  AV  block 
without  a  pacemaker  and  warrants  cautious  administration  in 
patients  with  intraventricular  conduction  disorders.  Worsening  of 
existing  ventricular  arrhythmias  or  the  onset  of  new  ventricular 
arrhythmias can occur in 5% to 30% of patients, especially in those 
with preexisting sustained VT, cardiac decompensation, and higher 
doses  of  the  drug.  Failure  of  the  flecainide-related  arrhythmia  to 
respond to therapy, including electrical cardioversion-defibrillation, 
may  result  in  mortality  as  high  as  10%  in  patients  in  whom  proar-
rhythmic  events  develop.  Negative  inotropic  effects  can  precipitate 
or worsen heart failure episodes. Patients with sinus node dysfunc-
tion  may  experience  sinus  arrest,  and  an  increase  in  the  pacing 
threshold may develop in those with pacemakers. In CAST, patients 
treated with flecainide had 5.1% mortality or nonfatal cardiac arrest 
versus 2.3% in the placebo group during a 10-month period. Mortality 
was highest in those with nonQ-wave infarction, frequent PVCs, and 
faster heart rates, thus raising the possibility of drug interaction with 
ischemia and electrical instability. Exercise can amplify the conduc-
tion  slowing  in  the  ventricle  produced  by  flecainide  and  in  some 
cases can precipitate a proarrhythmic response. Therefore, exercise 
testing has been recommended to screen for proarrhythmia (as well 
as  occult  ischemia).  Central  nervous  system  complaints,  including 
confusion  and  irritability,  represent  the  most  frequent  noncardiac 
adverse  effects.  The  safety  of  flecainide  during  pregnancy  has  not 
been  determined,  although  as  noted  previously,  it  is  occasionally 
used to treat fetal arrhythmias. It is concentrated in breast milk to a 
level 2.5- to 4-fold higher than in plasma.

Propafenone
Propafenone  has  been  approved  by  the  FDA  for  the  treatment  of 
patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as well as 
atrial fibrillation.

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Propafenone blocks the fast sodium 
current in a use-dependent manner in Purkinje fibers and to a lesser 
degree in ventricular muscle (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5). 
Its use-dependent effects contribute to its ability to terminate atrial 
fibrillation. Its dissociation constant from the receptor is slow, similar 
to  that  of  flecainide.  Effects  are  greater  in  ischemic  than  in  normal 
tissue and with reduced membrane potentials. Propafenone decreases 
excitability  and  suppresses  spontaneous  automaticity  and  triggered 
activity. The drug is a weak blocker of IKr and beta-adrenergic recep-
tors. Although ventricular refractoriness increases, slowing of conduc-
tion  is  the  major  effect.  Propafenone  has  several  active  metabolites 
that exert electrophysiologic effects. It depresses sinus node automa-
ticity,  and  the  A-H,  H-V,  PR,  and  QRS  intervals  increase,  as  do  the 
refractory  periods  of  all  tissues.  The  QT  interval  increases  only  as  a 
function of increased QRS duration.

Hemodynamic Effects.  Propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone 
exhibit negative inotropic properties at high concentrations. In patients 
with  left  ventricular  ejection  fractions  exceeding  40%,  the  negative 
inotropic effects are well tolerated, but patients with preexisting left 
ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure may have symp-
tomatic worsening of their hemodynamic status.

Pharmacokinetics.  With  more  than  95%  of  the  drug  absorbed, 
the maximum plasma concentration of propafenone is achieved in 2 
to 3 hours (see Table 35-4). Systemic bioavailability is dose dependent 
and ranges from 3% to 40% because of variable presystemic clear-
ance. Bioavailability increases as the dose increases, and the plasma 
concentration  is  therefore  not  linearly  related  to  dose.  A  3-fold 
increase in dosage (300 to 900 mg/day) results in a 10-fold increase 
in plasma concentration, presumably because of saturation of hepatic 
metabolic  mechanisms.  Propafenone  is  97%  bound  to  alpha1-acid 
glycoprotein, with an elimination half-life of 5 to 8 hours. Maximum 
therapeutic effects occur at serum concentrations of 0.2 to 1.5 mg/
mL. The marked interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and phar-
macodynamics may be the result of genetically determined differences 

695

in metabolism (see Chapter 9). Approximately 7% of the population 
are  poor  metabolizers  and  have  an  elimination  half-life  of  15  to  20 
hours for the parent compound and almost no 5-hydroxypropafenone. 
The  (+)-enantiomer  provides  nonspecific  beta-adrenergic  receptor 
blockade with 2.5% to 5% of the potency of propranolol, but because 
plasma propafenone concentrations may be 50 or more times higher 
than propranolol levels, these beta-blocking properties may be rele-
vant.  Poor  metabolizers  have  a  greater  beta-adrenergic  receptor
blocking effect than extensive metabolizers do.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  Most patients respond to oral 
doses of 150 to 300 mg every 8 hours, not to exceed 1200 mg/day (see 
Table 35-4). Doses are similar for patients of both metabolizing pheno-
types. A sustained-release form is available for the treatment of atrial 
fibrillation;  dosing  is  225  to  425 mg  twice  daily.  Concomitant  food 
administration  increases  its  bioavailability,  as  does  hepatic  dysfunc-
tion. No good correlation between the plasma propafenone concentra-
tion and suppression of arrhythmia has been shown. Doses should not 
be increased more often than every 3 to 4 days. Propafenone increases 
plasma concentrations of warfarin, digoxin, and metoprolol.

INDICATIONS.  Propafenone is indicated for the treatment of par-
oxysmal  SVT,  atrial  fibrillation,  and  life-threatening  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias and effectively suppresses spontaneous PVCs and 
nonsustained and sustained VT.7 Acute termination of atrial fibrilla-
tion  episodes  occurred  with  a  single  600-mg  oral  dose  of  propafe-
none in 76% of patients given the drug (twice the rate of those given 
placebo).  It  has  been  used  effectively  in  the  pediatric  age  group. 
Propafenone increases the pacing threshold but minimally affects the 
defibrillation threshold. The sinus rate during exercise is reduced.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  Minor  noncardiac  effects  occur  in  approxi-
mately  15%  of  patients,  with  dizziness,  disturbances  in  taste,  and 
blurred vision being the most common and gastrointestinal side effects 
next. Exacerbation of bronchospastic lung disease can occur because 
of  mild  beta-blocking  effects.  Cardiovascular  side  effects  develop  in 
10% to 15% of patients, including AV block, sinus node depression, and 
worsening  of  heart  failure.  Proarrhythmic  responses,  which  occur 
more often in patients with a history of sustained VT and decreased 
ejection fractions, appear less commonly than with flecainide (5%). 
Applicability of data from CAST about flecainide to propafenone is not 
clear, but limiting the application of propafenone in a manner similar 
to that of other class IC drugs seems prudent. Its beta-blocking actions 
may make it different, however. The safety of propafenone administra-
tion during pregnancy has not been established (class C).

Moricizine
As of December 31, 2007, moricizine (Ethmozine) is no longer avail-
able in the United States.

Class II Agents
Beta AdrenoceptorBlocking Agents
Although  many  beta  adrenoceptorblocking  drugs  have  been 
approved for use in the United States, metoprolol, carvedilol, atenolol, 
propranolol, and esmolol have been most widely used to treat supra-
ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Acebutolol, nadolol, timolol, 
betaxolol, pindolol, and bisoprolol have been used less extensively 
for  the  treatment  of  arrhythmias.  Metoprolol,  atenolol,  carvedilol, 
timolol, and propranolol decrease overall mortality and sudden death 
after myocardial infarction (see Chapter 39). It is generally thought 
that beta blockers possess class effects and that when titrated to the 
proper dose, all can be used effectively to treat cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypertension, or other disorders. However, differences in pharmaco-
kinetic  or  pharmacodynamic  properties  that  confer  safety,  reduce 
adverse effects, or affect dosing intervals or drug interactions influ-
ence the choice of agent. For example, nadolol may be particularly 
effective in patients with long-QT syndrome (see Chapter 32). Also, 
some beta blockers, such as sotalol, pindolol, and carvedilol, exert 
unique actions in addition to beta receptor blockade.

Beta  receptors  can  be  separated  into  those  that  affect  predomi-
nantly  the  heart  (beta1)  and  those  that  affect  predominantly  blood 
vessels and the bronchi (beta2). In low doses, selective beta blockers 
can block beta1 receptors more than they block beta2 receptors and

might be preferable for the treatment of patients with pulmonary or 
peripheral vascular disease. In high doses, the selective beta1 block-
ers also block beta2 receptors. Carvedilol also exerts alpha-blocking 
effects and is used primarily in patients with heart failure (see Chap-
ters 23 to 25). It is not an ideal agent for rate control in atrial fibril-
lation  because  of  the  alpha-blockinginduced  hypotension  that 
accompanies doses large enough to block the AV node.

Some beta blockers exert intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; that 
is, they slightly activate the beta receptor. These drugs appear to be 
as  efficacious  as  beta  blockers  without  intrinsic  sympathomimetic 
actions and may cause less slowing of the heart rate at rest and less 
prolongation of AV nodal conduction time. They have been shown to 
induce less depression of left ventricular function than do beta block-
ers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Beta blockers without 
intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have been shown to reduce mortal-
ity in patients after myocardial infarction, with nonselective agents 
possibly conferring slightly greater benefit (see Chapters 51 and 52).
The  following  discussion  focuses  on  the  use  of  propranolol  as  a 
prototypic antiarrhythmic agent but is generally applicable to other 
beta blockers.

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Beta blockers exert an electrophysi-
ologic action by competitively inhibiting binding of catecholamine at 
beta  adrenoceptor  sites,  an  effect  almost  entirely  the  result  of  the 
()-levorotatory  stereoisomer,  or  by  their  quinidine-like  or  direct 
membrane-stabilizing action (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5). 
The latter is a local anesthetic effect that depresses INa and membrane 
responsiveness  in  cardiac  Purkinje  fibers,  occurs  at  concentrations 
generally  10  times  those  necessary  to  produce  beta  blockade,  and 
most likely plays an insignificant antiarrhythmic role. Thus, beta block-
ers exert their major effects in cells most actively stimulated by adren-
ergic  actions.  At  a  beta-blocking  concentration,  propranolol  slows 
spontaneous automaticity in the sinus node or in Purkinje fibers that 
are being stimulated by adrenergic tone and produces an If block (see 
Chapter  33).  Beta  blockers  also  block  the  ICa.L  stimulated  by  beta 
agonists. In the absence of adrenergic stimulation, only high concen-
trations  of  propranolol  slow  normal  automaticity  in  Purkinje  fibers, 
probably by a direct membrane action.

Concentrations  that  cause  beta  receptor  blockade  but  no  local 
anesthetic effects do not alter the normal resting membrane potential, 
maximum  diastolic  potential  amplitude,  (cid:31)Vmax,  repolarization,  or 
refractoriness  of  atrial,  Purkinje,  or  ventricular  muscle  cells  in  the 
absence  of  catecholamine  stimulation.  However,  in  the  presence  of 
isoproterenol, a relatively pure beta receptor stimulator, beta blockers 
reverse  isoproterenols  accelerating  effects  on  repolarization.  Pro-
pranolol reduces the amplitude of digitalis-induced delayed afterde-
polarizations and suppresses triggered activity in Purkinje fibers.

Concentrations exceeding 3 mg/mL are required to depress  (cid:31)Vmax, 
action  potential  amplitude,  membrane  responsiveness,  and  conduc-
tion in normal atrial, ventricular, and Purkinje fibers without altering 
resting  membrane  potential.  These  effects  probably  result  from 
depression  of  INa.  Long-term  administration  of  propranolol  may 
lengthen the APD. Similar to the effects of lidocaine, acceleration of 
repolarization of Purkinje fibers is most marked in areas of the ven-
tricular conduction system in which the APD is greatest.

Propranolol  slows  the  sinus  discharge  rate  in  humans  by  10%  to 
20%, although severe bradycardia occasionally results if the heart is 
particularly dependent on sympathetic tone or if sinus node dysfunc-
tion is present. The PR interval lengthens, as do AV nodal conduction 
time  and  AV  nodal  effective  and  functional  refractory  periods  (at  a 
constant heart rate), but refractoriness and conduction in the normal 
His-Purkinje system remain unchanged, even after high doses of pro-
pranolol.  Therefore,  therapeutic  doses  of  propranolol  in  humans  do 
not exert a direct depressant or quinidine-like action but influence 
cardiac electrophysiology through a beta-blocking action. Beta block-
ers  do  not  affect  conduction  or  repolarization  in  normal  ventricular 
muscle, as evidenced by their lack of effect on the QRS complex and 
QT interval, respectively.

Because  administration  of  beta  blockers  that  do  not  have  direct 
membrane action prevents many arrhythmias resulting from activation 
of the autonomic nervous system, it is thought that the beta-blocking 
action is responsible for their antiarrhythmic effects. Nevertheless, the 
possible importance of the direct membrane effect of some of these 
drugs cannot be discounted totally because beta blockers with direct 
membrane  actions  can  affect  the  transmembrane  potentials  of 

diseased cardiac fibers at much lower concentrations than are needed 
to  affect  normal  fibers  directly.  However,  indirect  actions  on  the 
arrhythmogenic  effects  of 
the  most 
important.

ischemia  are  probably 

Hemodynamic  Effects.  Beta  blockers  exert  negative  inotropic 
effects  and  can  precipitate  or  worsen  heart  failure.  However,  beta 
blockers  clearly  improve  survival  in  patients  with  heart  failure   
(see Chapter 25). By blocking beta receptors, these drugs may allow 
unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects to produce peripheral vasocon-
striction and exacerbate coronary artery spasm or pain from peripheral 
vascular disease in some patients.

Pharmacokinetics.  Although various types of beta blockers exert 
similar pharmacologic effects, their pharmacokinetics differs substan-
tially. Propranolol is almost 100% absorbed, but the effects of first-
pass  hepatic  metabolism  reduce  its  bioavailability  to  approximately 
30% and produce significant interpatient variability in plasma concen-
tration  with  a  given  dose  (see  Table  35-4).  Reduced  hepatic  blood 
flow, as in patients with heart failure, decreases the hepatic extraction 
of propranolol; in these patients, propranolol may further decrease its 
own  elimination  rate  by  reducing  cardiac  output  and  hepatic  blood 
flow.  Beta  blockers  eliminated  by  the  kidneys  tend  to  have  longer 
half-lives and exhibit less interpatient variability in drug concentration 
than do beta blockers metabolized by the liver.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.  The appropriate dose of pro-
pranolol is best determined by a measure of the patients physiologic 
response,  such  as  changes  in  resting  heart  rate  or  prevention  of 
exercise-induced sinus tachycardia, because wide individual differ-
ences  exist  between  the  observed  physiologic  effect  and  plasma 
concentration. For example, intravenous dosing is best achieved by 
titration of the dose to clinical effect, beginning with doses of 0.25 to 
0.50 mg, increasing to 1.0 mg if necessary, and administering doses 
every 5 minutes until either a desired effect or toxicity is produced 
or a total of 0.15 to 0.20 mg/kg has been given. In many cases, the 
short-acting  effects  of  esmolol  are  preferred.  Orally,  propranolol  is 
given in four divided doses, usually ranging from 40 to 160 mg/day 
to more than 1 g/day (see Table 35-4). Some beta blockers, such as 
carvedilol and pindolol, need to be given twice daily; many are avail-
able as once-daily long-acting preparations. In general, if one agent 
in  adequate  doses  does  not  produce  the  desired  effect,  other  beta 
blockers will also be ineffective. Conversely, if one agent produces 
the desired physiologic effect but a side effect develops, another beta 
blocker can often be substituted successfully.

INDICATIONS.  Arrhythmias  associated  with  thyrotoxicosis  or 
pheochromocytoma  and  arrhythmias  largely  related  to  excessive 
cardiac  adrenergic  stimulation,  such  as  those  initiated  by  exercise, 
emotion,  or  cocaine,  often  respond  to  beta  blocker  therapy.  Beta-
blocking drugs do not usually convert chronic atrial flutter or atrial 
fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm but may do so if the arrhythmia is 
of recent onset and in patients who have recently undergone cardiac 
surgery. The atrial rate during atrial flutter or fibrillation is not changed, 
but the ventricular response decreases because beta blockade pro-
longs AV nodal conduction time and refractoriness. Esmolol can be 
used intravenously for rapid control of the heart rate. For reentrant 
SVTs using the AV node as one of the reentrant pathways, such as AV 
nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and orthodromic reciprocating 
tachycardia  in  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome  or  inappropriate 
sinus tachycardia, or for AT, beta blockers can slow or terminate the 
tachycardia and can be used prophylactically to prevent a recurrence. 
Combining  beta  blockers  with  digitalis,  quinidine,  or  various  other 
agents can be effective when the beta blocker as a single agent fails. 
Metoprolol and esmolol may be useful in patients with multifocal AT. 
These agents must be used with caution in patients with this arrhyth-
mia,  however,  because  a  common  setting  for  it  is  advanced  lung 
disease, often with a bronchospastic component.

Beta  blockers  can  be  effective  for  digitalis-induced  arrhythmias 
such as AT, nonparoxysmal AV junctional tachycardia, PVCs, or VT. 
If a significant degree of AV block is present during digitalis-induced 
arrhythmia, lidocaine or phenytoin may be preferable to propranolol. 
Beta  blockers  can  also  be  useful  to  treat  ventricular  arrhythmias 
associated with prolongedQT interval syndrome (see Chapter 32) 
and with mitral valve prolapse (see Chapter 63). For patients with 

ischemic heart disease, beta blockers do not generally prevent the 
episodes of recurrent monomorphic VT that occur in the absence of 
acute ischemia. It is well accepted that several beta blockers reduce 
the incidence of both total and sudden death after myocardial infarc-
tion (see Chapters 51 and 52). The mechanism of this reduction in 
mortality is not entirely clear and may be related to reduction of the 
extent of ischemic damage, autonomic effects, a direct antiarrhyth-
mic effect, or combinations of these factors. Beta blockers may have 
been protective against proarrhythmic responses in CAST.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  Adverse  cardiovascular  effects  from  beta 
blockers  include  unacceptable  hypotension,  bradycardia,  and  con-
gestive heart failure. The bradycardia can be caused by sinus slowing 
or  AV  block.  Sudden  withdrawal  of  propranolol  in  patients  with 
angina  pectoris  can  precipitate  or  worsen  angina  and  cardiac 
arrhythmias  and  cause  acute  myocardial  infarction,  possibly  as  a 
result of the heightened sensitivity to beta agonists caused by previ-
ous  beta  blockade  (receptor  upregulation).  Heightened  sensitivity 
may begin several days after cessation of beta blocker therapy and 
can last 5 or 6 days. Other adverse effects of beta blockers include 
worsening of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inter-
mittent  claudication,  Raynaud  phenomenon,  mental  depression, 
increased  risk  for  hypoglycemia  in  insulin-dependent  diabetic 
patients, easy fatigability, disturbingly vivid dreams or insomnia, and 
impaired sexual function. Many of these side effects were noted less 
frequently with the use of beta1-selective agents, but even so-called 
cardioselective  beta  blockers  can  exacerbate  asthma  or  diabetic 
control in individual patients.

Class III Agents
Amiodarone
Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative approved by the FDA for the 
treatment  of  patients  with  life-threatening  ventricular  tachyarrhyth-
mias when other drugs are ineffective or not tolerated. Dronedarone, 
a noniodinated derivative of amiodarone, is approved by the FDA for 
the treatment of atrial fibrillation (see later).

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  When  it  is  chronically  given  orally, 
amiodarone prolongs the APD and refractoriness of all cardiac fibers 
without affecting resting membrane potential (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 
35-3, and 35-5 and Chapter 33). When acute effects are evaluated, 
amiodarone and its metabolite desethylamiodarone prolong the APD 
of ventricular muscle but shorten the APD of Purkinje fibers. Injected 
into  the  sinus  and  AV  node  arteries,  amiodarone  reduces  sinus  and 
junctional discharge rates and prolongs AV nodal conduction time. It 
depresses  (cid:31)V max  in  ventricular  muscle  in  a  rate-  or  use-dependent 
manner by blocking of inactivated sodium channels, an effect that is 
accentuated by depolarized and reduced by hyperpolarized membrane 
potentials. Amiodarone depresses conduction at fast rates more than 
at slow rates (use dependence), not only by depressing  (cid:31)Vmax but also 
by increasing resistance to passive current flow. It does not prolong 
repolarization more at slow than at fast rates (i.e., does not demon-
strate reverse use dependence) but does exert time-dependent effects 
on  refractoriness,  which  may  in  part  explain  its  high  antiarrhythmic 
efficacy and low incidence of torsades de pointes.

Desethylamiodarone  has  relatively  greater  effects  on  fast-channel 
tissue, which probably contributes notably to its antiarrhythmic efficacy. 
The  delay  in  building  up  adequate  concentrations  of  this  metabolite 
may in part explain the delay in amiodarones antiarrhythmic action.

Amiodarone  noncompetitively  antagonizes  alpha  and  beta  recep-
tors  and  blocks  conversion  of  thyroxine  (T4)  to  triiodothyronine  (T3), 
which may account for some of its electrophysiologic effects. Amio-
darone exhibits slow-channelblocking effects; with oral administra-
tion,  it  slows  the  sinus  rate  by  20%  to  30%  and  prolongs  the  QT 
interval, at times changing the contour of the T wave and producing 
U waves.

The ERP of all cardiac tissues is prolonged. The H-V interval increases 
and the QRS duration lengthens, especially at fast rates. Amiodarone 
given intravenously modestly prolongs the refractory period of atrial 
and ventricular muscle. The PR interval and AV nodal conduction time 
lengthen.  The  duration  of  the  QRS  complex  lengthens  at  increased 
rates but less than after oral amiodarone. Thus, a far less increase in 
prolongation of conduction time (except for the AV node), duration 
intravenous 
of  repolarization,  and 

refractoriness  occurs  after

administration than after the oral route. Considering these actions, it 
is clear that amiodarone has class I (blocks INa), class II (antiadrenergic), 
and  class  IV  (blocks  ICa.L)  actions  in  addition  to  its  class  III  effects 
(blocks IK). Amiodarones actions approximate those of a theoretically 
ideal drug that exhibits use-dependent Na+ channel blockade with fast 
diastolic recovery from block and use-dependent prolongation of the 
APD. It does not increase and may decrease QT dispersion. Catechol-
amines can partially reverse some of the effects of amiodarone.

Hemodynamic Effects.  Amiodarone is a peripheral and coronary 
vasodilator.  When  administered  intravenously  (150 mg  over  a  10- 
minute period, then a 1-mg/min infusion), amiodarone decreases the 
heart  rate,  systemic  vascular  resistance,  left  ventricular  contractile 
force, and left ventricular dP/dt. Oral doses of amiodarone sufficient 
to control cardiac arrhythmias do not depress the left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction, even in patients with reduced ejection fractions, and the 
ejection fraction and cardiac output may increase slightly. However, 
because of the antiadrenergic actions of amiodarone and because it 
does  exert  some  negative  inotropic  action,  it  should  be  given  cau-
tiously,  particularly  intravenously,  to  patients  with  marginal  cardiac 
compensation.

Pharmacokinetics.  Amiodarone  is  slowly,  variably,  and  incom-
pletely absorbed, with a systemic bioavailability of 35% to 65% (see 
Table  35-4).  Plasma  concentrations  peak  3  to  7  hours  after  a  single 
oral  dose.  There  is  a  minimal  first-pass  effect,  thus  indicating  little 
hepatic  extraction.  Elimination  is  by  hepatic  excretion  into  bile  with 
some  enterohepatic  recirculation.  Extensive  hepatic  metabolism 
occurs,  with  desethylamiodarone  being  a  major  metabolite.  Both 
accumulate extensively in the liver, lung, fat, blue skin, and other 
tissues. The concentration in myocardium is 10 to 50 times that found 
in plasma. Plasma clearance of amiodarone is low, and renal excretion 
is negligible. Doses need not be reduced in patients with renal disease. 
Amiodarone and desethylamiodarone are not dialyzable. The volume 
of distribution is large but variable, with an average of 60 L/kg. Amio-
darone is highly protein bound (96%), crosses the placenta (10% to 
50%), and is found in breast milk.

The  onset  of  action  after  intravenous  administration  generally 
occurs  within  1  to  2  hours.  After  oral  administration,  the  onset  of 
action may require 2 to 3 days, often 1 to 3 weeks, and on occasion 
even longer. Loading doses reduce this time interval. Plasma concen-
trations relate well to oral doses during chronic treatment and average 
approximately 0.5 mg/mL for each 100 mg/day at doses between 100 
and 600 mg/day. Its elimination half-life is multiphasic, with an initial 
50% reduction in plasma concentration 3 to 10 days after cessation 
of  drug  ingestion  (probably  representing  elimination  from  well-
perfused  tissues),  followed  by  a  terminal  half-life  of  26  to  107  days 
(mean, 53 days), with most patients being in the 40- to 55-day range. 
To achieve a steady-state concentration without a loading dose takes 
about  265  days.  Interpatient  variability  in  these  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  mandates  close  monitoring  of  the  patient.  Therapeutic 
serum concentrations range from 1 to 2.5 mg/mL. Greater suppres-
sion of arrhythmias may occur with up to 3.5 mg/mL, but the risk for 
side effects increases.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  An  optimal  dosing  schedule 
for all patients has not been achieved. One recommended approach 
is to treat with 800 to 1200 mg/day for 1 to 3 weeks, 400 mg/day for 
the next several weeks, and finally after 2 to 3 months of treatment, 
a maintenance dose of 300 mg or less per day (see Table 35-4). Main-
tenance drug can be given once or twice daily and should be titrated 
to  the  lowest  effective  dose  to  minimize  the  occurrence  of  side 
effects;  in  general,  the  earlier  during  drug  loading  that  arrhythmia 
control is achieved, the lower the maintenance dose can be. Doses 
as  low  as  100 mg/day  can  be  effective  in  some  patients.  Regimens 
must be individualized for a given patient and clinical situation. To 
achieve more rapid loading and effect in emergencies, amiodarone 
can be administered intravenously at initial doses of 15 mg/min for 
10 minutes, followed by 1 mg/min for 6 hours and then 0.5 mg/min 
for the remaining 18 hours and the next several days as necessary. 
Supplemental  infusions  of  150 mg  over  a  10-minute  period  can  be 
used for breakthrough VT or VF. Intravenous infusions can be con-
tinued safely for 2 to 3 weeks. Intravenous amiodarone is generally 
well  tolerated,  even  in  patients  with  left  ventricular  dysfunction. 
Patients with depressed ejection fractions should receive intravenous 
amiodarone  with  great  caution  because  of  hypotension.  High- 
dose  oral  loading  (800  to  2000 mg/day  to  maintain  trough  serum

concentrations  of  2  to  3 mg/mL)  may  suppress  ventricular  arrhyth-
mias in 1 to 2 days.

INDICATIONS.  Amiodarone  has  been  used  to  suppress  a  wide 
spectrum  of  supraventricular  and  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  in 
utero, in adults, and in children, including AV node and AV reentry 
junctional tachycardia, atrial flutter and fibrillation, VT and VF associ-
ated  with  coronary  artery  disease,  and  hypertrophic  cardiomyopa-
thy.  Success  rates  vary  widely,  depending  on  the  population  of 
patients,  arrhythmia,  underlying  heart  disease,  length  of  follow-up, 
definition and determination of success, and other factors. In general, 
however,  the  efficacy  of  amiodarone  equals  or  exceeds  that  of  all 
other antiarrhythmic agents and may be in the range of 60% to 80% 
for most supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and 40% to 60% for ven-
tricular tachyarrhythmias. Amiodarone may be useful in improving 
survival  in  patients  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  asymptom-
atic ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction, and ventricu-
lar  tachyarrhythmia  during  and  after  resuscitation  from  cardiac 
arrest. Amiodarone given before open heart surgery, as well as post-
operatively, has been shown to decrease the incidence of postopera-
tive atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone is superior to class I antiarrhythmic 
agents and sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with recur-
rent atrial fibrillation.

Patients who have an ICD receive fewer shocks if they are treated 
with  amiodarone  than  if  treated  with  conventional  drugs.  Amioda-
rone has little effect on the pacing threshold but typically increases 
the electrical defibrillation threshold slightly.

Several  prospective,  randomized,  controlled  trials  and  meta-
analyses  have  demonstrated  improved  survival  with  amiodarone 
therapy  versus  placebo;  however,  amiodarone  has  been  proved  to 
result  in  inferior  survival  in  comparison  to  ICD  therapy,  and  in  the 
SCD-HeFT population (Class II or III heart failure; ejection fraction, 
35%), survival of amiodarone-treated patients was no different from 
that of those treated with placebo. The drug may still be used adjunc-
tively  in  ICD-treated  patients  to  decrease  the  frequency  of  shocks 
from VT and VF episodes or to control supraventricular tachyarrhyth-
mias that elicit device therapy (see Chapter 37). The drug can slow 
the  ventricular  rate  during  spontaneous  VT  episodes  beneath  the 
detection  rate  of  the  device;  careful  patient  assessment  and,  occa-
sionally, device reprogramming and testing are necessary. It also can 
be used to slow the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation and atrial 
flutter.

Because of the serious nature of the arrhythmias being treated, the 
unusual pharmacokinetics of the drug, and its adverse effects, con-
sideration should be given to starting amiodarone therapy with the 
patient hospitalized and monitored for at least several days. Combin-
ing other antiarrhythmic agents with amiodarone may improve effi-
cacy in some patients.

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  Adverse effects are reported by about 75% of 
patients  treated  with  amiodarone  for  5  years,  and  these  effects 
compel stopping use of the drug in 18% to 37%. The most frequent 
side  effects  requiring  drug  discontinuation  involve  pulmonary  and 
gastrointestinal  complaints  or  abnormal  test  results.  Most  adverse 
effects are reversible with dose reduction or cessation of treatment. 
Adverse effects are more common when therapy is continued in the 
long term and at higher doses. Of the noncardiac adverse reactions, 
pulmonary toxicity is the most serious8; in one study it occurred in 
33 of 573 patients between 6 days and 60 months of treatment, with 
three deaths. The mechanism is unclear but may involve a hypersen-
sitivity  reaction,  widespread  phospholipidosis,  or  both.  Dyspnea, 
nonproductive cough, and fever are common symptoms, along with 
crackles  on  examination,  hypoxia,  abnormal  gallium  scan  results, 
reduced diffusion capacity, and radiographic evidence of pulmonary 
infiltrates.  Amiodarone  must  be  discontinued  if  such  pulmonary 
inflammatory  changes  occur.  Corticosteroids  can  be  tried,  but  no 
controlled studies have been done to support their use. Ten percent 
mortality results in patients with pulmonary inflammatory changes, 
often  in  those  with  unrecognized  pulmonary  involvement  that  is 
allowed  to  progress.  Chest  radiography  and  pulmonary  function 
testing,  including  carbon  monoxide  diffusion  capacity  (Dlco),  at 
3-month intervals for the first year and then twice a year for several 

years  have  been  recommended.  At  maintenance  doses  lower  than 
300 mg/day,  pulmonary  toxicity  is  uncommon  but  can  occur. 
Advanced age, high drug maintenance dose, and reduced predrug 
diffusion capacity are risk factors for the development of pulmonary 
toxicity. An unchanged Dlco on therapy may be a negative predictor 
of pulmonary toxicity.

Although asymptomatic elevations in liver enzyme levels are found 
in most patients, the drug is not stopped unless values exceed two 
or  three  times  normal  in  a  patient  with  initially  normal  values.  Cir-
rhosis  occurs  uncommonly  but  may  be  fatal.9  Neurologic  dysfunc-
tion, photosensitivity (perhaps minimized by sunscreens), bluish skin 
discoloration,  gastroenterologic  disturbances,  and  hyperthyroidism 
(1% to 2%) or hypothyroidism (2% to 4%) can occur.10 Because amio-
darone appears to inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, chemi-
cal changes result and are characterized by a slight increase in T4, 
reverse  T3,  and  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  (TSH)  and  a  slight 
decrease in T3 levels. The reverse T3 concentration has been used as 
an  index  of  drug  efficacy.  During  hypothyroidism  the  TSH  level 
increases greatly, whereas the level of T3 increases in hyperthyroid-
ism. Thyroid function tests should be performed approximately every 
3 months for the first year while amiodarone is being taken and once 
or twice yearly thereafter, sooner if symptoms develop that are con-
sistent  with  thyroid  dysfunction.  Corneal  microdeposits  occur  in 
almost 100% of adults receiving the drug longer than 6 months. More 
serious  ocular  reactions,  including  optic  neuritis  and  atrophy  with 
visual loss, have been reported but are rare, and causation by amio-
darone has not been established.

Cardiac side effects include symptomatic bradycardias in approxi-
mately  2%  of  patients;  worsening  of  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias 
with the occasional development of torsades de pointes in 1% to 2%, 
possibly higher in women; and worsening of congestive heart failure 
in  2%.  Possibly  because  of  interactions  with  anesthetics,  complica-
tions  after  open  heart  surgery,  including  pulmonary  dysfunction, 
hypotension,  severe  bradycardia,  hepatic  dysfunction,  and  low 
cardiac output, have been noted by some investigators.

In general, the lowest possible maintenance dose of amiodarone 
that  is  still  effective  should  be  used  to  avoid  significant  adverse 
effects. Many supraventricular arrhythmias can be managed success-
fully  with  daily  dosages  of  200 mg  or  less,  whereas  ventricular 
arrhythmias  generally  require  higher  doses.  Adverse  effects  are 
uncommon at dosages of 200 mg/day or less but still occur. Because 
of  potential  toxicity  in  various  organ  systems,  special  multidisci-
plinary amiodarone clinics have been used by some in an attempt to 
prevent adverse outcomes when the drug is used.

Important  interactions  with  other  drugs  occur,  and  when  given 
concomitantly with amiodarone, the doses of warfarin, digoxin, and 
other antiarrhythmic drugs should be reduced by a third to a half and 
the patient observed closely. Drugs with synergistic actions, such as 
beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, must be given cautiously. 
The  safety  of  amiodarone  during  pregnancy  has  not  been  estab-
lished, and it should be used in pregnant patients only if no alterna-
tives exist.

Dronedarone
Dronedarone  is  approved  by  the  FDA  to  facilitate  maintenance  of 
sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter and fibrillation.

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Like amiodarone, dronedarone alters 
the  activity  of  multiple  cardiac  ion  channels  (see  Tables  35-1,  35-2, 
35-3,  and  35-5).  It  is  a  more  potent  blocker  of  the  rapid  sodium 
current than amiodarone is and exhibits similar effects on the L-type 
calcium  current.  Blockade  of  both  the  rapid  and  slow  components   
of  the  delayed  rectifier  potassium  current  by  dronedarone  is  also 
similar  to  that  by  amiodarone,  whereas  its  effect  on  the  atrial 
acetylcholine-activated potassium current and antiadrenergic effects 
(via noncompetitive binding) are significantly more potent than that 
of amiodarone. Sinus node function is depressed to a minor degree. 
Pacing and defibrillation thresholds are slightly increased.

Hemodynamic Effects.  Dronedarone has little effect on cardiac per-
formance except in patients with compromised ventricular systolic func-
tion and should not be used in those with clinical signs of heart failure.

Pharmacokinetics.  Dronedarone  is  70%  to  90%  absorbed  after 
oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations being achieved 
in  3  to  4  hours;  absorption  is  enhanced  by  food  (see  Table  35-4). 
Unlike the very long half-life of amiodarone, the elimination half-life 
of  dronedarone  is  13  to  19  hours,  with  85%  of  the  drug  being 
excreted unchanged in feces and the remainder in urine. Dronedarone 
is metabolized by and slightly inhibits the activity of CYP3A4 (as well 
as CYP2D6) and should not be used in conjunction with other agents 
that  strongly  inhibit  these  enzyme  systems.  There  is  little  warfarin 
interaction, but dronedarone increases serum levels of dabigatran.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  The standard recommended 
dose is 400 mg every 12 hours with food (see Table 35-4). No paren-
teral form is currently available.

INDICATIONS.  Dronedarone  is  indicated  to  facilitate  cardiover-
sion  of  atrial  flutter  or  fibrillation  or  to  maintain  sinus  rhythm  after 
restoration of sinus rhythm. It is slightly less effective than amioda-
rone  in  these  regards.11  In  the  ANDROMEDA  (Antiarrhythmic  Trial 
with  Dronedarone  in  Moderate-to-Severe  Congestive  Heart  Failure 
Evaluating Morbidity Decrease) study, dronedarone-treated patients 
had  a  mortality  rate  more  than  twice  that  of  placebo  (8.1%  versus 
3.8%). Similarly, in the PALLAS (Permanent Atrial Fibrillation Outcome 
Study Using Dronedarone on Top of Standard Therapy) trial, patients 
with permanent atrial fibrillation who were taking dronedarone had 
a greater than twofold higher risk for death, stroke, systemic embo-
lism, or myocardial infarction than did control patients.12 Thus, the 
medication  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  current  or  recent 
episodes  of  clinical  heart  failure  or  in  those  with  permanent  atrial 
fibrillation  (as  a  rate  control  agent).  Patients  taking  dronedarone 
should be evaluated periodically to ensure that permanent fibrillation 
or heart failure has not developed.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  A  transient,  predictable  increase  in  serum 
creatinine, without adversely affecting actual glomerular filtration or 
other measures of renal function, occurs with standard dosing and 
is not a reason to alter the dose or to discontinue use of the drug. As 
noted, patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart 
failure, as well as those with permanent atrial fibrillation, should not 
be  given  the  drug  because  these  patients  have  higher  mortality. 
Patients  with  severe  liver  dysfunction  should  not  generally  receive 
the drug. The QT interval is predictably prolonged, but proarrhythmic 
effects from this or other mechanisms are rare (although sinus brady-
cardia is sometimes seen). Rash, photosensitivity, nausea, diarrhea, 
dyspepsia, headache, and asthenia have occurred in treated patients 
at higher frequency than in controls. Absence of the iodine molecule 
appears to account for the lower prevalence of lung and thyroid toxic-
ity in dronedarone-treated patients than in those taking amiodarone. 
Dronedarone should not be used during pregnancy (category X, evi-
dence or risk of fetal harm) and is possibly unsafe for breast feeding.

Bretylium Tosylate
Bretylium is a quaternary ammonium compound that had been used 
parenterally in patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhyth-
mias. Because of poor efficacy, it is no longer manufactured or avail-
able in the United States.

Sotalol
Sotalol is a nonspecific beta adrenoceptor blocker without intrinsic 
sympathomimetic activity that prolongs repolarization. It is approved 
by the FDA to treat patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias and those with atrial fibrillation.

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Both the d- and l-isomers have similar 
effects on prolonging repolarization, whereas the l-isomer is responsi-
ble for almost all the beta-blocking activity (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, 
and  35-5).  Sotalol  does  not  block  alpha  adrenoceptors  and  does   
not block the sodium channel (no membrane-stabilizing effects) but 
does prolong atrial and ventricular repolarization times by reducing IKr, 
thus prolonging the plateau of the action potential. Action potential 
prolongation  is  greater  at  slower  rates  (reverse  use  dependence). 
Resting  membrane  potential,  action  potential  amplitude,  and  (cid:31)Vmax 
are  not  significantly  altered.  Sotalol  prolongs  atrial  and  ventricular 
refractoriness,  A-H  and  QT  intervals,  and  sinus  cycle  length  (see 
Chapter 37).

699

Hemodynamics.  Sotalol  exerts  a  negative  inotropic  effect  only 
through its beta-blocking action. Although it can increase the strength 
of contraction by prolonging repolarization, which occurs maximally at 
slow heart rates, the negative inotropic effects predominate. In patients 
with reduced cardiac function, sotalol can decrease the cardiac index, 
increase filling pressure, and precipitate overt heart failure. Therefore, 
it must be used cautiously in patients with marginal cardiac compensa-
tion but is well tolerated in those with normal cardiac function.

Pharmacokinetics.  Sotalol is completely absorbed and not metab-
olized, thus making it 90% to 100% bioavailable. It is not bound to 
plasma proteins, is excreted unchanged primarily by the kidneys, and 
has an elimination half-life of 10 to 15 hours (see Table 35-4). Peak 
plasma  concentrations  occur  2.5  to  4  hours  after  oral  ingestion.   
Over the dose range of 160 to 640 mg, sotalol displays dose propor-
tionality  with  plasma  concentration  (usually  in  the  range  of  2.5 µg/
mL).  The  dose  must  be  reduced  in  patients  with  renal  disease.  The   
beta-blocking  effect  is  half-maximal  at  80 mg/day  and  maximal  at 
320 mg/day.

DOSAGE.  The  typical  oral  dose  is  80  to  160 mg  every  12  hours, 
with 2 to 3 days being allowed between dose adjustments to attain a 
steady-state  concentration  and  to  monitor  the  ECG  for  arrhythmias 
and QT prolongation (see Table 35-4). Doses exceeding 320 mg/day 
can be used in patients when the potential benefits outweigh the risk 
for proarrhythmia. Because of its ability to significantly prolong the 
QT interval in some patients and cause torsades de pointes or provoke 
severe bradycardia, consideration should be given to inpatient initia-
tion of the drug, especially in those with atrial fibrillation (in whom 
conversion to sinus bradycardia may cause syncope and/or further 
QT  prolongation  at  slow  rates),  as  well  as  in  women  (with  longer 
baseline QT intervals).

INDICATIONS.  Approved  by  the  FDA  to  treat  patients  with  ven-
tricular tachyarrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, sotalol is also useful 
to prevent recurrence of a wide variety of SVTs, including atrial flutter, 
AT, AV node reentry, and AV reentry (see Chapter 37). It also slows 
the ventricular response to atrial tachyarrhythmias. It appears to be 
more effective than conventional antiarrhythmic drugs and may be 
comparable to amiodarone in the treatment of patients with ventricu-
lar tachyarrhythmias, as well as in prevention of recurrences of atrial 
fibrillation  after  cardioversion.  It  has  been  used  successfully  to 
decrease  the  incidence  of  atrial  fibrillation  after  cardiac  surgery.13 
Sotalol  may  be  effective  in  fetal  and  pediatric  patients  and  young 
adults with congenital heart disease.14 Unlike most other antiarrhyth-
mic  drugs,  it  may  decrease  the  frequency  of  ICD  discharges  and 
reduce the defibrillation threshold.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  Proarrhythmia  is  the  most  serious  adverse 
effect. Overall, new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur 
in approximately 4% of patients; this response is the result of torsades 
de  pointes  in  around  2.5%  but  increases  to  4%  in  patients  with  a 
history of sustained VT and is dose related (only 1.6% at 320 mg/day 
but 4.4% at 480 mg/day). This proarrhythmic effect was probably the 
cause of excess mortality in patients given d-sotalol (the enantiomer 
lacking  a  beta-blocking  effect)  after  acute  myocardial  infarction  in 
the SWORD (Survival With Oral d-Sotalol) trial. Other adverse effects 
commonly seen with other beta blockers also apply to sotalol. Sotalol 
should be used with caution or not at all in combination with other 
drugs that prolong the QT interval. However, such combinations have 
occasionally been used successfully.

Ibutilide
Ibutilide  is  an  agent  released  for  acute  termination  of  episodes  of 
atrial flutter and fibrillation (see Chapter 37).

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Like  other  class  III  agents,  ibutilide 
prolongs  repolarization  (see  Tables  35-1,  35-2,  35-3,  and  35-5). 
Although it is similar to other class III agents that block outward potas-
sium currents, such as IKr, ibutilide is unique in that it also activates a 
slow  inward  sodium  current.  Administered  intravenously,  ibutilide 
causes mild slowing of the sinus rate and has minimal effects on AV 
conduction  or  QRS  duration,  but  the  QT  interval  is  characteristically 
prolonged. Ibutilide has no significant effect on hemodynamics.

Pharmacokinetics.  Ibutilide  is  administered  intravenously  and 
has  a  large  volume  of  distribution  (see  Table  35-4).  Clearance  is

predominantly renal, with a drug half-life averaging 6 hours, but with 
considerable interpatient variability. Protein binding is approximately 
40%. One of the drugs metabolites has weak class III effects.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.  Ibutilide is given as an intra-
venous infusion of 1 mg over a 10-minute period (see Table 35-4). It 
should  not  be  given  in  the  presence  of  a  QTc  interval  longer  than  
440  milliseconds  or  other  drugs  that  prolong  the  QT  interval  or  in 
patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or brady-
cardia. A second 1-mg dose may be given after the first dose is fin-
ished  if  the  arrhythmia  persists.  Patients  must  have  continuous 
electrocardiographic monitoring throughout the dosing period and 
for 6 to 8 hours thereafter because of the risk for ventricular arrhyth-
mias.  Pretreatment  with  intravenous  magnesium  may  decrease  the 
risk  for  ventricular  arrhythmias  and  enhance  efficacy  in  treating 
some atrial arrhythmias.15 Up to 60% of patients with atrial fibrillation 
and 70% of those with atrial flutter convert to sinus rhythm after 2 mg 
of ibutilide has been administered.

INDICATIONS.  Ibutilide  is  indicated  for  termination  of  an  estab-
lished episode of atrial flutter or fibrillation. It should not be used in 
patients with frequent short paroxysms of atrial fibrillation because 
it merely terminates episodes and is not useful for long-term preven-
tion. Patients whose condition is hemodynamically unstable should 
proceed  to  direct-current  cardioversion.  Ibutilide  has  been  used 
safely  and  effectively  in  patients  who  were  already  taking  amioda-
rone or propafenone but should be used with caution in these cases. 
Ibutilide has been administered at the time of transthoracic electrical 
cardioversion to increase the likelihood of termination of atrial fibril-
lation. In one study, all 50 patients given ibutilide before attempted 
electrical cardioversion achieved sinus rhythm, whereas only 34 of 
50 who did not receive the drug converted to sinus rhythm. Of note, 
all 16 patients who did not respond to electrical cardioversion without 
ibutilide were successfully electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm 
when a second attempt was made after ibutilide pretreatment.

Ibutilide prolongs accessory pathway refractoriness and can tem-
porarily slow the ventricular rate during preexcited atrial fibrillation. 
The drug can also occasionally terminate episodes of organized AT, 
as well as sustained, uniform-morphology VT.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  The  most  significant  adverse  effect  of  ibuti-
lide is QT prolongationrelated torsades de pointes, which occurs in 
approximately 2% of patients given the drug (twice as often in women 
as in men). This effect develops within the first 4 to 6 hours of dosing, 
after which the risk is negligible. Thus, patients in whom the drug is 
used must undergo electrocardiographic monitoring for up to 8 hours 
after dosing. This requirement can make the use of ibutilide in emer-
gency departments or private offices problematic. The safety of ibuti-
lide during pregnancy has not been well studied, and its use in this 
setting should be restricted to patients in whom no safer alternative 
exists.

Dofetilide
Dofetilide is approved for the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to 
sinus  rhythm,  as  well  as  for  chronic  suppression  of  recurrent  atrial 
fibrillation.16

Electrophysiologic Actions.  The sole electrophysiologic effect of 
dofetilide is block of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potas-
sium current (IKr), important in repolarization (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 
35-3, and 35-5). This effect is more prominent in the atria than in the 
ventricles30% increase in the atrial refractory period versus 20% in 
the ventricle. The effect of dofetilide on IKr is prolongation of refractori-
ness  without  slowing  conduction,  which  is  believed  to  be  largely 
responsible for its antiarrhythmic effect. It is also responsible for pro-
longation of the QT interval on the ECG, which averages 11% but can 
be much greater. This effect on the QT interval is dose dependent and 
linear. No other important electrocardiographic changes are observed 
with the drug. It has no significant hemodynamic effects. Dofetilide is 
more effective than quinidine at converting atrial fibrillation to sinus 
rhythm. Its long-term efficacy is similar to that of other agents.17

Pharmacokinetics.  Orally administered dofetilide is absorbed well, 
and more than 90% is bioavailable. Its mean elimination half-life is 7 
to 13 hours, with 50% to 60% of the drug being excreted unchanged 

in urine (see Table 35-4). The remainder of the drug undergoes hepatic 
metabolism  to  inert  compounds.  Significant  drug-drug  interactions 
have been reported in patients taking dofetilide; cimetidine, verapamil, 
ketoconazole, and trimethoprim, alone or in combination with sulfa-
methoxazole,  cause  a  significant  elevation  in  the  dofetilide  serum 
concentration and should not be used with this drug.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.  Dofetilide is available only as 
an oral preparation. Dosing is from 0.125 to 0.5 mg twice daily and 
must be initiated in a hospital setting with continuous electrocardio-
graphic  monitoring  to  ensure  that  inordinate  QT  prolongation  and 
torsades de pointes do not develop (see Table 35-4). Physicians must 
be  specially  certified  to  prescribe  the  drug.  Its  dosage  must  be 
decreased in the presence of impaired renal function or an increase 
in the QT interval of more than 15%, or 500 milliseconds. The drug 
should not be given to patients with a creatinine clearance lower than 
20 mL/min or a baseline QTc interval longer than 440 milliseconds.
INDICATIONS.  Oral  dofetilide  is  indicated  for  prevention  of  epi-
sodes of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter 
and fibrillation. The role of dofetilide in the treatment of ventricular 
arrhythmias is less clear; it has been shown to decrease the defibril-
lation threshold in patients with an ICD, as well as decrease the fre-
quency of ICD therapies for ventricular arrhythmias.18

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  The most significant adverse effect of dofeti-
lide  is  QT  interval  prolongationrelated  torsades  de  pointes,  which 
occurs  in  2%  to  4%  of  patients  given  the  drug.  Risk  is  highest  in 
patients  with  a  baseline  prolonged  QT  interval,  in  those  who  are 
hypokalemic, in those taking some other agent that prolongs repolar-
ization, and after conversion from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. 
Because the risk for torsades de pointes is highest at the time of drug 
initiation,  it  should  be  used  continuously  and  not  as  intermittent 
outpatient dosing. The drug is otherwise well tolerated, with few side 
effects. Its use in pregnancy has not been studied extensively, and it 
should probably be avoided in this setting if possible.
Class IV Agents
Calcium Channel Antagonists: Verapamil and Diltiazem
Verapamil,  a  synthetic  papaverine  derivative,  is  the  prototype  of  a 
class of drugs that block the slow calcium channel and reduce ICa.L 
in  cardiac  muscle  (see  Chapter  33).  Diltiazem  has  electrophysio-
logic actions similar to those of verapamil. Nifedipine and other dihy-
dropyridine  agents  exhibit  minimal  electrophysiologic  effects  at 
clinically used doses; these drugs are not discussed here.

Electrophysiologic Actions.  By blocking ICa.L in all cardiac fibers, 
verapamil reduces the plateau height of the action potential, slightly 
shortens muscle action potential, and slightly prolongs Purkinje fiber 
action potential (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5). It does not 
appreciably affect the action potential amplitude,  (cid:31)Vmax of phase 0, 
or resting membrane voltage in cells that have fast-response charac-
teristics  related  to  INa  (e.g.,  atrial  and  ventricular  muscle,  the  His-
Purkinje  system).  Verapamil  suppresses  slow  responses  elicited  by 
various experimental methods, as well as sustained triggered activity 
and early and late afterdepolarizations. Verapamil and diltiazem sup-
press electrical activity in the normal sinus and AV nodes. Verapamil 
depresses  the  slope  of  diastolic  depolarization  in  sinus  node  cells,   
(cid:31)Vmax  of  phase  0,  and  maximum  diastolic  potential  and  prolongs 
conduction  time  and  refractory  periods  of  the  AV  node.  The  AV 
nodeblocking effects of verapamil and diltiazem are more apparent 
at  faster  rates  of  stimulation  (use  dependence)  and  in  depolarized 
fibers  (voltage  dependence).  Verapamil  slows  activation  of  the  slow 
channel and delays its recovery from inactivation.

Verapamil  does  exert  some  local  anesthetic  activity  because  the 
d-isomer of the clinically used racemic mixture exerts slight blocking 
effects on INa. The l-isomer blocks the slow inward current carried by 
calcium,  as  well  as  other  ions,  traveling  through  the  slow  channel. 
Verapamil  does  not  affect  calcium-activated  adenosine  triphospha-
tase, nor does it block beta receptors, but it may block alpha receptors 
and  potentiate  vagal  effects  on  the  AV  node.  Verapamil  may  also 
cause other effects that indirectly alter cardiac electrophysiology, such 
as decreasing platelet adhesiveness or reducing the extent of myocar-
dial ischemia.

In  humans,  verapamil  prolongs  conduction  time  through  the  AV 
node  (the  A-H  interval)  and  lengthens  AV  nodal  anterograde  and 

retrograde  refractory  periods  without  affecting  the  P  wave  or  QRS 
duration or the H-V interval. The spontaneous sinus rate may decrease 
slightly, an effect only partially reversed by atropine. More commonly, 
the sinus rate does not change significantly because verapamil causes 
peripheral vasodilation, transient hypotension, and reflex sympathetic 
stimulation, which mitigates any direct slowing effect that verapamil 
exerts on the sinus node. If verapamil is given to a patient who is also 
receiving  a  beta  blocker,  the  sinus  node  discharge  rate  may  slow 
because reflex sympathetic stimulation is blocked. Verapamil does not 
exert a significant direct effect on atrial or ventricular refractoriness 
or on the anterograde or retrograde properties of accessory pathways. 
However,  reflex  sympathetic  stimulation  after  intravenous  verapamil 
administration may increase the ventricular response over the acces-
sory pathway during atrial fibrillation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-
White syndrome, sometimes dangerously so.

Hemodynamic  Effects.  Because  verapamil 

interferes  with 
excitation-contraction  coupling,  it  inhibits  vascular  smooth  muscle 
contraction  and  causes  marked  vasodilation  in  coronary  and  other 
peripheral vascular beds. The reflex sympathetic effects of verapamil 
may reduce its marked negative inotropic action on isolated cardiac 
muscle, but the direct myocardial depressant effects of verapamil may 
predominate when the drug is given in high doses. In patients with 
well-preserved left ventricular function, combined therapy with pro-
pranolol and verapamil appears to be well tolerated, but beta block-
ade  can  accentuate  the  hemodynamic  depressant  effects  produced 
by oral verapamil. Patients with reduced left ventricular function may 
not  tolerate  the  combined  blockade  of  beta  receptors  and  calcium 
channels;  thus,  in  these  patients,  verapamil  and  propranolol  should 
be  used  in  combination  either  cautiously  or  not  at  all.  Verapamil 
reduces myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing coronary vascu-
lar resistance. Such changes may be indirectly antiarrhythmic.

Peak  alterations  in  hemodynamic  variables  occur  3  to  5  minutes 
after completion of a verapamil injection, with the major effects dis-
sipating  within  10  minutes.  Systemic  resistance  and  mean  arterial 
pressure decrease, as does left ventricular dP/dtmax, and left ventricular 
end-diastolic pressure increases. Heart rate, cardiac index, and mean 
pulmonary  artery  pressure  do  not  change  significantly  in  individuals 
with normal resting left ventricular systolic function. Thus the after-
load  reduction  produced  by  verapamil  significantly  counterbalances 
its negative inotropic action, so the cardiac index may not be reduced. 
In addition, when verapamil slows the ventricular rate in a patient with 
tachycardia, hemodynamics may also improve. Nevertheless, caution 
should be exercised in giving verapamil to patients with severe myo-
cardial  depression  or  those  receiving  beta  blockers  or  disopyramide 
because hemodynamic deterioration may progress in some patients.
Pharmacokinetics.  After single oral doses of verapamil, measur-
able prolongation of AV nodal conduction time occurs in 30 minutes 
and lasts 4 to 6 hours (see Table 35-4). After intravenous administra-
tion, AV nodal conduction delay occurs within 1 to 2 minutes and A-H 
interval prolongation is still detectable after 6 hours. After oral admin-
istration, absorption is almost complete, but its overall bioavailability 
of 20% to 35% suggests substantial first-pass metabolism in the liver, 
particularly  of  the  l-isomer.  The  drugs  elimination  half-life  is  3  to  7 
hours,  with  up  to  70%  of  the  drug  being  excreted  by  the  kidneys. 
Norverapamil is a major metabolite that may contribute to the elec-
trophysiologic actions of verapamil. Serum protein binding is approxi-
mately 90%. With diltiazem, the percentage of heart rate reduction 
in atrial fibrillation is related to its plasma concentration.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  For  acute  termination  of 
SVT  or  rapid  achievement  of  ventricular  rate  control  during  atrial 
fibrillation, the most commonly used intravenous dose of verapamil 
is 10 mg infused over a 1- to 2-minute period while cardiac rhythm 
and blood pressure are monitored (see Table 35-4). A second injec-
tion of an equal dose may be given 30 minutes later. The initial effect 
achieved  with  the  first  bolus  injection,  such  as  slowing  of  the  
ventricular  response  during  atrial  fibrillation,  can  be  maintained  
by continuous infusion of the drug at a rate of 0.005 mg/kg/min. The 
oral dose is 240 to 480 mg/day in divided doses. Diltiazem is given 
intravenously  at  a  dose  of  0.25 mg/kg  as  a  bolus  over  a  2-minute 
period,  with  a  second  dose  in  15  minutes  if  necessary;  because  
it  is  generally  better  tolerated  (less  hypotension)  with  long-term 
administration, such as for control of the ventricular rate during atrial 
fibrillation,  diltiazem  is  preferred  over  verapamil  in  this  setting.  
Significant  hypotension  resulting  from  intravenous  diltiazem  can  
be  countered  by  volume  expansion  or  the  judicious  use  of  a  pure

vasoconstrictor agent such as phenylephrine. Orally, doses must be 
adjusted to the patients needs, with a 120- to 360-mg range. Various 
long-acting preparations (once daily) are available for verapamil and 
diltiazem.

INDICATIONS.  After  simple  vagal  maneuvers  have  been  tried  and 
adenosine has been given, intravenous verapamil or diltiazem is the next 
treatment  of  choice  for  termination  of  sustained  AV  node  reentry  or 
orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia associated with an accessory 
pathway (see Chapter 37). Verapamil is as effective as adenosine for 
termination  of  these  arrhythmias.  Assuming  that  the  patient  is  stable, 
verapamil should definitely be tried before termination is attempted by 
digitalis administration, pacing, electrical direct-current cardioversion, 
or  acute  blood  pressure  elevation  with  vasopressors.  Verapamil  and 
diltiazem  terminate  60%  to  90%  or  more  episodes  of  paroxysmal  SVT 
within several minutes. Verapamil may also be of use in some fetal SVTs. 
Although intravenous verapamil has been given along with intravenous 
propranolol, this combination should be used only with great caution 
because of combined adverse hemodynamic effects.

Verapamil  and  diltiazem  decrease  the  ventricular  response  over 
the AV node during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, possibly convert-
ing  a  small  number  of  episodes  to  sinus  rhythm,  particularly  if  the 
atrial  flutter  or  fibrillation  is  of  recent  onset.  In  addition,  verapamil 
may  prevent  early  recurrence  of  atrial  fibrillation  after  electrical  
cardioversion.  Atrial  fibrillation  may  develop  in  some  patients  with 
atrial  flutter  after  verapamil  administration.  As  noted  earlier,  in 
patients with preexcited ventricular complexes during atrial fibrilla-
tion  associated  with  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome,  intravenous 
verapamil  may  accelerate  the  ventricular  response;  therefore  the 
intravenous route is contraindicated in this situation. Verapamil can 
terminate some ATs. Even though verapamil can often terminate an 
idiopathic left septal VT, hemodynamic collapse can occur if intrave-
nous verap amil is given to patients with the more common forms of 
VT  because  they  generally  occur  in  the  setting  of  decreased  left 
ventricular  systolic  function.  A  general  rule  for  avoiding  complica-
tions,  however,  is  to  not  administer  verapamil  intravenously  to  any 
patient with wide-QRS tachycardia unless one is absolutely certain 
of  the  nature  of  the  tachycardia  and  its  probable  response  to 
verapamil.

Orally,  verapamil  or  diltiazem  can  prevent  the  recurrence  of  AV 
node  reentrant  and  orthodromic  AV  reciprocating  tachycardias  
associated  with  an  accessory  pathway,  as  well  as  help  maintain  a 
decreased ventricular response during atrial flutter or atrial fibrilla-
tion  in  patients  without  an  accessory  pathway.  Verapamil  has  not 
generally been effective in treating patients who have recurrent ven-
tricular  tachyarrhythmias,  although  it  may  suppress  some  forms  of 
VT,  such  as  left  septal  VT  (noted  earlier).  It  may  also  be  useful  in 
about two thirds of patients with idiopathic VT that has a left bundle 
branch  block  morphology  (right  ventricular  outflow  tract  origin), 
patients  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  who  have  experienced 
cardiac arrest, patients with a short-coupled variant of polymorphic 
VT,  and  patients  with  ventricular  arrhythmias  related  to  coronary 
artery  spasm.  Calcium  channel  blockers  have  not  been  shown  to 
reduce mortality or to prevent sudden cardiac death in patients after 
acute myocardial infarction, except for diltiazem in those with non
ST-segment elevation infarctions (see Chapter 53).

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  Verapamil must be used cautiously in patients 
with significant hemodynamic impairment or in those receiving beta 
blockers, as noted earlier. Hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and 
asystole are more likely to occur when the drug is given to patients 
who are already receiving beta-blocking agents. Hemodynamic col-
lapse has been noted in infants, and verapamil should be used cau-
tiously  in  children  younger  than  1  year.  Verapamil  should  also  be 
used with caution in patients with sinus node abnormalities because 
marked depression of sinus node function or asystole can result in 
some of these patients. Intravenous isoproterenol, calcium, glucagon, 
dopamine,  or  atropine,  which  may  be  only  partially  effective,  or 
temporary  pacing  may  be  necessary  to  counteract  some  of  the 
adverse effects of verapamil. Isoproterenol may be more effective for 
the treatment of bradyarrhythmias, and calcium may be used for the 
treatment of hemodynamic dysfunction secondary to verapamil. AV

node depression is common in overdoses. Contraindications to the 
use  of  verapamil  and  diltiazem  include  the  presence  of  advanced 
heart failure, second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker 
in place, atrial fibrillation and anterograde conduction over an acces-
sory pathway, significant sinus node dysfunction, most VTs, cardio-
genic  shock,  and  other  hypotensive  states.  Although  these  drugs 
should probably not be used in patients with overt heart failure, if it 
is  caused  by  one  of  the  supraventricular  tachyarrhythmias  noted 
earlier,  verapamil  or  diltiazem  may  restore  sinus  rhythm  or  signifi-
cantly  decrease  the  ventricular  rate  and  thereby  lead  to  hemody-
namic improvement. Finally, verapamil can decrease the excretion 
of digoxin by approximately 30%. Hepatotoxicity may occur on occa-
sion.  Verapamil  crosses  the  placental  barrier;  its  use  in  pregnancy 
has been associated with impaired uterine contraction, fetal brady-
cardia, and possibly fetal digital defects. It should therefore be used 
only if no effective alternatives exist.

Other Antiarrhythmic Agents
Adenosine
Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside present throughout the body 
and has been approved by the FDA to treat patients with SVTs.

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Adenosine  interacts  with  A1  recep-
tors present on the extracellular surface of cardiac cells and activates 
K+ channels (IK.Ach, IK.Ado) in a fashion similar to that produced by ace-
tylcholine (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, and 35-5). The increase in K+ 
conductance  shortens  the  atrial  APD,  hyperpolarizes  the  membrane 
potential,  and  decreases  atrial  contractility.  Similar  changes  occur  in 
the sinus and AV nodes. In contrast to these direct effects mediated 
through the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins Gi and Go, aden-
osine  antagonizes  catecholamine-stimulated  adenylate  cyclase  to 
decrease  accumulation  of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  and  to 
decrease ICa.L and the pacemaker current If in sinus node cells along 
with a decrease in  (cid:31)Vmax. Shifts in the pacemaker site within the sinus 
node and sinus exit block may occur. Adenosine slows the sinus rate 
in humans, followed within seconds by a reflex increase in the sinus 
rate.  In  the  AV  node,  adenosine  produces  transient  prolongation  of 
the A-H interval, often with transient first-, second-, or third-degree 
AV  node  block  lasting  up  to  a  few  seconds.  The  delay  in  AV  nodal 
conduction is rate dependent. His-Purkinje conduction is not generally 
affected  directly.  Adenosine  does  not  affect  conduction  in  normal 
accessory pathways. Conduction may be blocked in unusual accessory 
pathways that have long conduction times or decremental conduction 
properties.  Patients  with  heart  transplants  exhibit  a  supersensitive 
response to adenosine. Adenosine may mediate the phenomenon of 
ischemic preconditioning.

Pharmacokinetics.  Adenosine  is  removed  from  the  extracellular 
space by washout, enzymatically by degradation to inosine, by phos-
phorylation  to  adenosine  monophosphate,  or  by  reuptake  into  cells 
through a nucleoside transport system (see Table 35-4). The vascular 
endothelium  and  erythrocytes  contain  these  elimination  systems, 
which result in very rapid clearance of adenosine from the circulation. 
Its elimination half-life is 1 to 6 seconds. Most of adenosines effects 
are produced during its first passage through the circulation. Impor-
tant drug interactions occur; methylxanthines are competitive antago-
nists, and therapeutic concentrations of theophylline totally block the 
exogenous effects of adenosine. Dipyridamole is a nucleoside trans-
port  blocker  that  blocks  reuptake  of  adenosine,  thus  delaying  its 
clearance from the circulation or interstitial space and potentiating its 
effect. Smaller adenosine doses should be used in patients receiving 
dipyridamole.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  To  terminate  tachycardia,  a 
bolus  of  adenosine  is  rapidly  injected  intravenously  at  doses  of  6  to 
12 mg, followed by a flush (see Table 35-4). Pediatric dosing should be 
0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg. When it is injected into a central vein and in patients 
after heart transplantation or those receiving dipyridamole, the initial 
dose should be reduced to 3 mg. Transient sinus slowing or AV node 
block results but lasts less than 5 seconds. Doses higher than 18 mg 
are unlikely to revert a tachycardia and should not be used.

INDICATIONS.  Adenosine has become the drug of first choice to 
terminate an SVT acutely, such as AV node or AV reentry (see Chapter 
37), and is useful in pediatric patients. Adenosine can produce AV 
nodal block or terminate ATs and sinus node reentry. It results in only 

transient AV block during atrial flutter or fibrillation and is thus useful 
only for diagnosis, not therapy. Adenosine terminates a group of VTs 
whose  maintenance  depends  on  adrenergic  drive,  which  is  most 
often located in the right ventricular outflow tract but can be found 
at  other  sites  as  well;  idiopathic  left  septal  VT  rarely  responds, 
however.  Adenosine  has  less  potential  than  verapamil  for  lowering 
blood pressure should tachycardia persist after injection.

Doses  as  low  as  2.5 mg  terminate  some  tachycardias;  doses  of 
12 mg or less terminate 92% of SVTs, usually within 30 seconds. Suc-
cessful  termination  rates  with  adenosine  are  comparable  to  those 
achieved with verapamil. Because of its effectiveness and extremely 
short duration of action, adenosine is preferable to verapamil in most 
cases, particularly in patients who have previously received intrave-
nous beta adrenoceptor blockers, in those with poorly compensated 
heart failure or severe hypotension, and in neonates. Verapamil might 
be  chosen  first  in  patients  receiving  drugs  such  as  theophylline 
(which is known to interfere with adenosines actions or metabolism), 
in patients with active bronchoconstriction, and in those with inad-
equate venous access.

Adenosine  may  be  useful  to  help  differentiate  among  causes  of 
wide-QRS tachycardias because it terminates many SVTs with aber-
rancy or reveals the underlying atrial mechanism and does not block 
conduction  over  an  accessory  pathway  or  terminate  most  VTs. 
However, in rare cases adenosine terminates some VTs, characteristi-
cally those of right ventricular outflow tract origin as noted earlier, 
and  therefore  tachycardia  termination  is  not  completely  diagnostic 
of  an  SVT.  This  agent  may  predispose  to  the  development  of  atrial 
fibrillation and might transiently increase the ventricular response in 
patients with atrial fibrillation conducting over an accessory pathway. 
Adenosine may also be useful in differentiating conduction over the 
AV node from that over an accessory pathway during ablative proce-
dures  designed  to  interrupt  the  accessory  pathway.  However,  this 
distinction is not absolute because adenosine can block conduction 
in  slowly  conducting  accessory  pathways  and  does  not  always 
produce block in the AV node.

ADVERSE EFFECTS.  Transient side effects occur in almost 40% of 
patients  with  SVT  given  adenosine  and  most  commonly  consist  of 
flushing, dyspnea, and chest pressure. These symptoms are fleeting, 
lasting less than 1 minute, and are well tolerated. PVCs, transient sinus 
bradycardia, sinus arrest, and AV block are common when an SVT is 
terminated abruptly. Atrial fibrillation is occasionally observed (12% 
in one study) with adenosine administration, perhaps because of the 
drugs  effect  in  shortening  atrial  refractoriness.  Induction  of  atrial 
fibrillation can be problematic in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White 
syndrome and rapid AV conduction over the accessory pathway.

Digoxin
Cardiac actions of digitalis glycosides have been recognized for cen-
turies.  Digoxin  is  used  for  control  of  supraventricular  arrhythmias, 
mainly control of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Use of 
digoxin  has  decreased  because  of  the  availability  of  agents  with 
greater potency and a wider therapeutic to toxic drug concentration 
range.

Electrophysiologic  Actions.  Digoxin  acts  mainly  through  the 
autonomic  nervous  system,  in  particular,  by  enhancing  both  central 
and peripheral vagal tone. These actions are confined largely to slowing 
of  the  sinus  node  discharge  rate,  shortening  of  atrial  refractoriness, 
and  prolongation  of  AV  nodal  refractoriness  (see  Tables  35-1,  35-2, 
35-3, and 35-5). Electrophysiologic effects on the His-Purkinje system 
and ventricular muscle are minimal, except with toxic concentrations. 
In studies of denervated hearts, digoxin has relatively little effect on 
the AV node and causes a mild increase in atrial refractoriness.

The sinus rate and P wave duration are minimally changed in most 
patients taking digoxin. The sinus rate may decrease in patients with 
heart  failure  whose  left  ventricular  performance  is  improved  by  the 
drug;  individuals  with  significant  underlying  sinus  node  disease  also 
have slower sinus rates or even sinus arrest. Similarly, the PR interval 
is generally unchanged, except in patients with underlying AV node 
disease. The QRS and QT intervals are unaffected. The characteristic 
ST and T wave abnormalities seen with use of digoxin do not represent 
toxicity.

Pharmacokinetics.  Intravenously  administered  digoxin  yields 
some  electrophysiologic  effect  within  minutes,  with  a  peak  effect 
occurring after 1.5 to 3 hours (see Table 35-4). After oral dosing, the 
peak effect occurs in 4 to 6 hours. The extent of digoxin absorption 
after  oral  administration  varies  according  to  the  preparation;  tablet 
forms  are  60%  to  75%  absorbed,  whereas  encapsulated  gel  forms 
are  almost  completely  absorbed.  Ingestion  of  cholestyramine  or  an 
antacid preparation at the same time as digoxin ingestion decreases 
its absorption. The serum half-life of digoxin is 36 to 48 hours, and 
the drug is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  In  acute  loading  doses  of 
0.5 to 1.0 mg, digoxin may be given orally or intravenously (see Table 
35-4). Chronic daily oral dosing should be adjusted on the basis of 
clinical indications and the extent of renal dysfunction. Most patients 
require  0.125  to  0.25 mg/day  as  a  single  dose.  However,  as  little  as 
0.125 mg every other day is needed in some patients undergoing renal 
dialysis, whereas young patients may require as much as 0.5 mg/day. 
Serum  digoxin  levels  may  be  used  to  monitor  compliance  with 
therapy, as well as to determine whether digitalis toxicity is the cause 
of  new  symptoms  compatible  with  the  diagnosis.  However,  routine 
monitoring of digoxin levels is not warranted in patients whose ven-
tricular rate is controlled during atrial fibrillation and who have no 
symptoms of toxicity.

INDICATIONS.  Digoxin can be used intravenously to slow the ven-
tricular rate during atrial fibrillation and flutter; it was formerly used in 
an attempt to convert SVTs to sinus rhythm, but its onset of action is 
much slower and its success rate less than that of adenosine, verap amil, 
or beta blockers. Thus it is now rarely used in this fashion. Digoxin is 
more commonly used orally to control the ventricular rate in permanent 
(chronic) atrial fibrillation. When a patient with atrial fibrillation is at 
rest  and  vagal  tone  predominates,  the  ventricular  rate  can  be  main-
tained  at  between  60  and  100  beats/min  in  40%  to  60%  of  cases. 
However,  when  the  patient  begins  to  exercise,  the  decrease  in  vagal 
tone and increase in adrenergic tone combine to diminish the benefi-
cial effects of digoxin on AV nodal conduction. Patients may experience 
a marked increase in ventricular rate with even mild exertion. Digoxin 
is therefore rarely used as a single agent to control the ventricular rate 
in  atrial  fibrillation.  The  drug  has  little  ability  to  prevent  episodes  of 
paroxysmal  atrial  fibrillation  or  to  control  the  ventricular  rate  during 
episodes  and  may  even  provoke  episodes  in  patients  with  so-called 
vagal atrial fibrillation. Finally, digoxin is no more effective than placebo 
in terminating episodes of acute- or recent-onset atrial fibrillation.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  One  major  reason  that  use  of  digoxin  has 
decreased is its potential for serious adverse effects and the narrow 
window between therapeutic and toxic concentrations. Digitalis tox-
icity  produces  various  symptoms  and  signs,  including  headache, 
nausea and vomiting, altered color perception, halo vision, and gen-
eralized  malaise.  Less  common  but  more  serious  than  these  are 
digitalis-related arrhythmias, which include bradycardias related to 
a markedly enhanced vagal effect (e.g., sinus bradycardia or arrest, 
AV node block) and tachyarrhythmias that may be caused by delayed 
afterdepolarizationmediated  triggered  activity  (e.g.,  atrial,  junc-
tional,  and  fascicular  or  ventricular  tachycardia).  Worsening  renal 
function,  advanced  age,  hypokalemia,  chronic  lung  disease,  hypo-
thyroidism, and amyloidosis increase a patients sensitivity to digitalis-
related arrhythmias. The diagnosis can be confirmed by determination 
of the serum digoxin level. Therapy for most bradycardias consists of 
withdrawal of digoxin; atropine or temporary pacing may be needed 
in symptomatic patients. Phenytoin can be used for control of atrial 
tachyarrhythmias, whereas lidocaine has been successful in treating 
infranodal tachycardias. Life-threatening arrhythmias can be treated 
with  digoxin-specific  antibody  fragments.  Electrical  direct-current 
cardioversion should be performed only when absolutely necessary 
in a digitalis-toxic patient because life-threatening VT or VF can result 
and  be  very  difficult  to  control.  Some  data  incriminate  digoxin  in 
increasing mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Ranolazine
Ranolazine, approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic angina, 
has  significant  electrophysiologic  properties.  It  has  been  shown  to 

decrease  the  incidence  of  atrial  fibrillation,  SVT,  and  ventricular 
arrhythmias  relative  to  controls  in  trials  of  the  drugs  antianginal 
effects.

703

Electrophysiologic Actions.  Ranolazine blocks IKr, as well as the 
late  Na  current;  at  higher  concentrations,  the  L-type  Ca  current  is 
mildly affected (see Tables 35-1, 35-2, 35-3, 35-5). The drug prolongs 
atrial  and  ventricular  refractoriness  and  induces  postrepolarization 
refractoriness; the P wave, PR interval, and QRS are unaffected, but 
the  QT  interval  is  mildly  prolonged.  Unlike  other  IKr-blocking  drugs, 
ranolazine does not induce early afterdepolarizations.19 Its effects are 
more pronounced on atrial than on ventricular myocardium, and the 
drug shows great promise for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

Hemodynamic  Effects.  Ranolazine  has  no  important  hemody-
namic effects; it does not appear to produce meaningful changes in 
contractility or vascular resistance.

Pharmacokinetics.  Absorption of orally administered ranolazine is 
mediated in part by the P-glycoprotein system, modulators of which 
may increase or decrease exposure to the drug. About 75% of a dose 
is  bioavailable,  with  peak  levels  being  reached  in  2  to  5  hours  (see 
Table 35-4). Absorption is not affected by food. Its half-life is approxi-
mately  7  hours;  hepatic  metabolism  to  minimally  or  wholly  inactive 
products  occurs  via  the  CYP3A  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  CYPD4 
pathways.  Approximately  75%  of  the  drug  is  excreted  in  urine,  the 
remainder in feces.

DOSAGE  AND  ADMINISTRATION.  The  typical  oral  dose  is 
500 mg twice daily, to a maximum of 1000 mg twice daily. The dose 
should be decreased in the setting of moderate liver disease. It should 
not  be  used  in  conjunction  with  strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A,  which 
could increase the drugs serum concentration threefold.

ADVERSE  EFFECTS.  The  most  widely  known  potential  adverse 
effect of the drug is QTc prolongation, which averages 6 to 15 milli-
seconds  (sometimes  more  in  patients  with  severe  liver  failure), 
because  of  inhibition  of  IKr.  Despite  this  effect  on  the  QT  interval, 
torsades de pointes is very rare. This is probably due in part to only 
modest QT prolongation combined with the drugs inhibition of the 
late inward Na current, which mitigates the QT effect. As noted above, 
ranolazine does not cause early afterdepolarizations or increases in 
transmural  dispersion  of  refractoriness,  which  are  believed  to  be 
prerequisites for torsades. Ranolazine produces a mild elevation in 
measured serum creatinine (0.1 mg/dL) without changing the actual 
glomerular filtration rate. The drug is pregnancy category C; its con-
centration in breast milk is unknown.

Antiarrhythmic Effects of Nonantiarrhythmic Drugs
Several medications commonly used for other indications also have 
some degree of antiarrhythmic effect. In some cases, physicians can 
use these drugs for their standard indications and achieve additional, 
although  often  small,  amounts  of  benefit  in  treating  the  patients 
rhythm disturbance. Among these drugs are angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptorblocking agents, aldos-
terone  antagonists  such  as  eplerenone,  statins  and  omega-3  fatty 
acids (prevention of sudden death), and these same classes of drugs 
with  the  addition  of  nondihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers 
and ranolazine (less atrial fibrillation and perhaps VF).20 The mecha-
nisms whereby these drugs exert their attenuating effect on arrhyth-
mias is not clear in most cases, and they should not be relied on as 
the sole form of antiarrhythmic therapy. In patients who have arrhyth-
mias, as well as another disorder that requires drug therapy (hyper-
tension, heart failure), one of these medications may be preferable to 
agents that treat the primary disorder but do not possess antiarrhyth-
mic effects.

Direct-CurrentElectricalCardioversion
Cardioversion  is  a  general  term  used  to  indicate  the  termination  
of  an  arrhythmia,  usually  a  tachyarrhythmia,  by  various  means, 
including  electrical,  pharmacologic,  or  manual/surgical.  Electrical 

704

cardioversion  refers  to  the  delivery  of 
an  electrical  shock  to  the  heart  to  ter-
minate a tachycardia, flutter, or fibrilla-
tion and includes the technique of both 
synchronous cardioversion (see below) 
and  defibrillation.  It  offers  obvious 
advantages over drug therapy because 
under  conditions  optimal  for  close 
supervision and monitoring, a precisely 
regulated  dose  of  electricity  can 
restore  sinus  rhythm  immediately  and 
safely.  The  distinction  between  supra-
ventricular  and  ventricular 
tachyar-
rhythmias,  crucial 
the  proper 
medical  management  of  arrhythmias, 
becomes less significant, and the time-
consuming 
titration  of  drugs  with 
potential side effects is obviated.

Mechanisms.  Electrical 

cardiover-
sion  is  most  effective  in  terminating 
tachycardias related to reentry, such as 
atrial  flutter  and  many  cases  of  atrial 
fibrillation, AV node reentry, reciprocat-
ing tachycardias associated with Wolff-
Parkinson-White syndrome, most forms 
of  VT,  ventricular  flutter,  and  VF.  The 
electrical  shock,  by  depolarizing  all 
excitable  myocardium  and  possibly  by 
prolonging 
interrupts 
reentrant circuits and establishes electri-
cal  homogeneity,  which 
terminates 
reentry.  The  mechanism  by  which  a 
shock successfully terminates VF has not 
been completely explained. If the precipitating factors are no longer 
present,  interruption  of  the  tachyarrhythmia  for  only  the  brief  time 
produced by the shock may prevent its return for long periods, even 
though  the  anatomic  and  electrophysiologic  substrates  required  for 
the tachycardia are still present.

refractoriness, 

Tachycardias thought to be caused by disorders of impulse forma-
tion  (automaticity)  include  parasystole,  some  forms  of  AT,  ectopic 
junctional tachycardia (with or without digitalis toxicity), accelerated 
idioventricular  rhythm,  and  relatively  uncommon  forms  of  VT  (see 
Chapters  33  and  37).  An  attempt  to  cardiovert  these  tachycardias 
electrically is not indicated in most cases because they typically recur 
within  seconds  after  the  shock;  release  of  endogenous  catechol-
amines consequent to the shock may further exacerbate the arrhyth-
mia. It has not been established whether cardioversion can terminate 
tachycardias caused by enhanced automaticity or triggered activity.

Technique.  Synchronous  cardioversion  refers  to  a  specific  tech-
nique  of  delivering  an  electrical  shock,  usually  of  lower  energy  and 
timed to the QRS complex (R wave), to avoid the vulnerable period 
of  the  T  wave.  Before  elective  synchronous  cardioversion,  careful 
physical examination, including palpation of limb pulses and inspec-
tion  of  the  chest  wall  and  airway,  should  be  performed.  A  12-lead 
ECG is obtained before and after cardioversion, as well as a rhythm 
strip during the electroshock. The patient, who should be informed 
completely about what to expect, is in a fasting state and metaboli-
cally  balanced;  that  is,  respiratory  function  and  electrolyte  values 
should be normal, with no evidence of drug toxicity. Withholding of 
digitalis  for  several  days  before  elective  cardioversion  in  patients 
without clinical evidence of digitalis toxicity is not necessary, although 
patients in whom digitalis toxicity is suspected should not be electri-
cally cardioverted until this situation has been corrected. Administra-
tion of maintenance antiarrhythmic drugs 1 to 2 days before planned 
electrical  cardioversion  of  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation  can  revert 
some patients to sinus rhythm, help prevent recurrence of atrial fibril-
lation  once  sinus  rhythm  is  restored,  and  assist  in  determining  the 
patients tolerance of the drug for long-term use.21 There is also evi-
dence that statin drugs,22 as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors and receptor blockers, may help prevent recurrence of fibril-
lation, especially in patients with ventricular dysfunction.

Self-adhesive  patches  applied  in  the  standard  apicoanterior  or 
anteroposterior  paddle  positions  have  transthoracic  impedances 
similar  to  those  of  paddles  and  are  useful  in  elective  synchronous 
cardioversions or other situations in which time is available for their 

application. Patches 12 to 13 cm in diameter can be used to deliver 
maximum  current  to  the  heart,  but  the  benefits  of  these  patches 
versus  patches  8  to  9 cm  in  diameter  have  not  been  clearly  estab-
lished.  Larger  patches  may  distribute  the  intracardiac  current  over  a 
wider area and reduce shock-induced myocardial injury.

A synchronized shock (i.e., one delivered during the QRS complex; 
Fig. 35-1) is used for all cardioversions except for very rapid ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias, such as ventricular flutter or VF. For defibrillation of 
the latter, energies greater than those for synchronous cardioversion 
are required, and synchronization is not necessary because there is no 
vulnerable period of the T wave to avoid. Although generally minimal, 
shock-related myocardial damage increases directly with increases in 
applied energy, and thus the minimum effective shock should be used. 
Therefore,  shocks  are  titrated  when  the  clinical  situation  permits. 
Except for atrial fibrillation, shocks in the range of 25 to 50 J success-
fully terminate most SVTs and should be tried initially. If the shock is 
unsuccessful, a second shock of higher energy can be delivered. The 
starting  level  to  terminate  atrial  fibrillation  with  older  monophasic 
machines  should  be  no  less  than  100  J,  but  with  newer  biphasic 
systems, a shock as low as 25 J may succeed.23 Delivered energy can 
be increased in stepwise fashion; up to 360 J can be used safely. It is 
critical  to  remember  to  resynchronize  the  defibrillator  to  the  QRS 
complex after an unsuccessful shock before delivery of another shock 
to avoid initiation of VF (machines typically revert to the asynchronous 
mode after each shock). Anteroposterior patches may have a higher 
efficacy  rate  by  placing  more  of  the  atrial  mass  in  the  shock  vector 
than is the case with apicoanterior patches. If a shock of 360 J fails 
to  convert  the  rhythm,  repeated  shocks  at  the  same  energy  may 
succeed by decreasing chest wall impedance; reversing patch polarity 
can  occasionally  help  as  well.  Administration  of  ibutilide  has  been 
shown to facilitate electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus 
rhythm. Intracardiac or transesophageal defibrillation can be tried if 
all attempts at external cardioversion fail. For patients with stable VT, 
starting levels in the range of 25 to 50 J can be used. If there is some 
urgency to terminate the tachyarrhythmia, one can begin with higher 
energies. To terminate VF, 100 to 200 J (biphasic; 200 to 360 J with 
monophasic machines) is generally used, although much lower ener-
gies (<50 J) terminate VF when the shock is delivered soon after onset 
of the arrhythmia, for example, using adhesive patches in the electro-
physiology laboratory.

During  elective  cardioversion,  a  short-acting  barbiturate  such  as 
methohexital,  a  sedative  such  as  propofol,  or  an  amnesic  such  as

diazepam  or  midazolam  can  be  used.  A  physician  skilled  in  airway 
management  should  be  in  attendance;  an  intravenous  route  should 
be  established;  and  pulse  oximetry,  the  ECG,  and  blood  pressure 
should be monitored. All equipment necessary for emergency resus-
citation should be immediately accessible. Before cardioversion, 100% 
oxygen may be administered for 5 to 15 minutes by nasal cannula or 
facemask and is continued throughout the procedure. Manual ventila-
tion of the patient may be necessary to avoid hypoxia during periods 
of  deepest  sedation.  Adequate  sedation  of  the  patient  undergoing 
even urgent cardioversion is essential.

In up to 5% of patients with atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm cannot 
be restored by external countershock despite all the preceding mea-
sures, including ibutilide pretreatment and biphasic shocks. It is impor-
tant to distinguish between inability to attain sinus rhythm, indicating 
inadequate  delivery  of  energy  to  the  atria,  and  inability  to  maintain 
sinus rhythm after transient termination of fibrillation; the latter condi-
tion (early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation) does not respond to higher-
energy  shocks  because  fibrillation  has  already  been  terminated  but 
quickly  recurs.  Pretreatment  with  an  antiarrhythmic  drug  may  help 
maintain  sinus  rhythm  after  subsequent  shocks.  Patients  in  whom 
atrial fibrillation simply cannot be terminated with an external shock 
tend to be very obese or have severe obstructive lung disease. In such 
cases, internal cardioversion can be performed with the use of spe-
cially configured catheters that have multiple large electrodes covering 
several centimeters of the distal portion of the catheter for distributing 
the shock energy. By standard percutaneous access, these catheters 
can  be  situated  in  the  lateral  part  of  the  right  atrium  and  coronary 
sinus to achieve a shock vector across most of the atrial mass. With 
such configurations, internal shocks of 2 to 15 J can terminate atrial 
fibrillation in more than 90% of patients whose arrhythmia is refrac-
tory  to  transthoracic  shock.  Esophageal  cardioversion  has  also  been 
reported.  Rarely,  simultaneous  shocks  from  two  defibrillators  have 
been reported to terminate refractory VF.

Indications
As a rule, any nonsinus tachycardia that produces hypotension, con-
gestive heart failure, mental status changes, or angina and does not 
respond  promptly  to  medical  management  should  be  terminated 
electrically. Very rapid ventricular rates in patients with atrial fibrilla-
tion and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are often best treated by 
electrical  cardioversion.  In  almost  all  cases  the  patients  hemody-
namic status improves after cardioversion. Rarely, a patient may expe-
rience  hypotension,  reduced  cardiac  output,  or  congestive  heart 
failure after the shock. This problem may be related to complications 
of the cardioversion, such as embolic events, myocardial depression 
resulting from the anesthetic agent or the shock itself, hypoxia, lack 
of  restoration  of  left  atrial  contraction  despite  return  of  electrical 
atrial systole, or postshock arrhythmias. Direct-current countershock 
of digitalis-induced tachyarrhythmias is contraindicated.

Favorable  candidates  for  electrical  cardioversion  of  atrial  fibrilla-
tion include patients who (1) have symptomatic atrial fibrillation of 
less than 12 months duration, (2) continue to have atrial fibrillation 
after the precipitating cause has been removed (e.g., after treatment 
of thyrotoxicosis), (3) have a rapid ventricular rate that is difficult to 
slow, or (4) have symptoms of decreased cardiac output (e.g., fatigue, 
lightheadedness, dyspnea) attributable to lack of atrial contractions 
contribution to ventricular filling. In patients who have indications for 
chronic  warfarin  therapy  to  prevent  stroke,  the  hope  of  avoiding 
anticoagulation by restoring sinus rhythm is not a reason to attempt 
cardioversion  because  these  patients  are  still  at  increased  risk  for 
thromboembolic events. Several large trials have shown that mainte-
nance of sinus rhythm confers no survival advantage over rate control 
and  anticoagulation;  thus,  not  all  patients  with  newly  discovered 
atrial  fibrillation  warrant  an  attempt  at  restoration  of  sinus  rhythm. 
Treatment must be determined individually.

Unfavorable candidates include patients with (1) digitalis toxicity; 
(2)  no  symptoms  and  a  well-controlled  ventricular  rate  without 
therapy; (3) sinus node dysfunction and various unstable supraven-
tricular  tachyarrhythmias  or  bradyarrhythmiasoften  bradycardia-
tachycardia  syndromein  whom  atrial  fibrillation  finally  develops 
and is maintained, which in essence represents a cure for sick sinus 
syndrome;  (4)  little  or  no  symptomatic  improvement  with  normal 
to  atrial  fibrillation  after  
sinus  rhythm  who  promptly  revert

cardioversion despite drug therapy; (5) a large left atrium and long-
standing atrial fibrillation; (6) episodes of atrial fibrillation that revert 
spontaneously to sinus rhythm; (7) no mechanical atrial systole after 
the  return  of  electrical  atrial  systole;  (8)  atrial  fibrillation  and 
advanced heart block; (9) cardiac surgery planned in the near future; 
and (10) antiarrhythmic drug intolerance. Atrial fibrillation is more 
likely  to  recur  after  cardioversion  in  patients  who  have  significant 
chronic  obstructive  lung  disease,  congestive  heart  failure,  mitral 
valve  disease  (particularly  mitral  regurgitation),  atrial  fibrillation 
present longer than 1 year, and an enlarged left atrium (echocardio-
graphic diameter larger than 4.5 cm).

In patients with atrial flutter, slowing the ventricular rate by admin-
istration of beta or calcium channel blockers or terminating the flutter 
with an antiarrhythmic agent may be difficult, and electrical cardio-
version is often the initial treatment of choice. For patients with other 
types  of  SVT,  electrical  cardioversion  may  be  used  when  (1)  vagal 
maneuvers or simple medical management (e.g., intravenous adeno-
sine and verapamil) has failed to terminate the tachycardia and (2) 
the  clinical  setting  indicates  that  fairly  prompt  restoration  of  sinus 
rhythm  is  desirable  because  of  hemodynamic  decompensation  
or  electrophysiologic  consequences  of  the  tachycardia.  Similarly,  
in patients with VT, the hemodynamic and electrophysiologic conse-
quences of the arrhythmias determine the need for and urgency of 
direct-current  cardioversion.  Electrical  countershock  is  the  initial 
treatment  of  choice  for  ventricular  flutter  or  VF.  Speed  is  essential 
(see Chapter 39).

If after the first shock, reversion of the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm 
does not occur, a higher energy level should be tried. When transient 
ventricular arrhythmias result after an unsuccessful shock, a bolus of 
lidocaine can be given before delivery of a shock at the next energy 
level.  If  sinus  rhythm  returns  only  transiently  and  is  promptly  sup-
planted by the tachycardia, a repeated shock can be tried, depending 
on the tachyarrhythmia being treated and its consequences. Admin-
istration  of  an  antiarrhythmic  agent  intravenously  may  be  useful 
before delivery of the next cardioversion shock (such as ibutilide for 
resistant atrial fibrillation). After cardioversion, the patient should be 
monitored,  at  least  until  full  consciousness  has  been  restored  and 
preferably for an hour or more thereafter, depending on the duration 
of recovery from the particular form of sedation or anesthesia used. 
If ibutilide has been given, the ECG should be monitored for up to 8 
hours because torsades de pointes can develop in the first few hours 
after administration.

Results
Electrical cardioversion restores sinus rhythm in up to 95% of patients, 
depending  on  the  type  of  tachyarrhythmia.  However,  sinus  rhythm 
remains after 12 months in less than a third to a half of patients with 
longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation. Thus, maintenance of sinus 
rhythm,  once  established,  is  the  difficult  problem,  not  immediate 
termination  of  the  tachyarrhythmia.  The  likelihood  of  maintaining 
sinus rhythm depends on the particular arrhythmia, the presence of 
underlying  heart  disease,  and  the  response  to  antiarrhythmic  drug 
therapy. Atrial size often decreases after termination of atrial fibrilla-
tion  and  restoration  of  sinus  rhythm,  and  functional  capacity 
improves.

Complications
Arrhythmias  induced  by  electrical  cardioversion  are  generally 
caused  by  inadequate  synchronization,  with  the  shock  occurring 
during the ST segment or T wave (see Fig. 35-1). On occasion, a prop-
erly synchronized shock can produce VF. Postshock arrhythmias are 
usually  transient  and  do  not  require  therapy.  Asystole  is  rare  and 
typically lasts no more than a few seconds before a sinus or junctional 
rhythm ensues; most defibrillators are also capable of transcutane-
ous pacing if needed. Embolic episodes are reported to occur in 1% 
to  3%  of  patients  converted  from  atrial  fibrillation  to  sinus  rhythm. 
Prior  therapeutic  anticoagulation  with  warfarin  (international  nor-
malized ratio [INR], 2.0 to 3.0) or newer agents such as dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, or apixaban should be used consistently for at least 3 
weeks by patients who have no contraindication to such therapy and

have had atrial fibrillation present for longer than 2 to 3 days 
or of indeterminate duration. It is important to note that 3 
weeks  of  therapeutic  anticoagulation  is  not  the  same  as 
simply administering warfarin for 3 weeks because the war-
farin  dose  may  not  achieve  a  therapeutic  INR.  The  newer 
agents confer almost immediate anticoagulation (such that 
3  weeks  of  treatment  equals  3  weeks  of  anticoagulation). 
Anticoagulation  for  at  least  4  weeks  afterward  is  recom-
mended because restoration of atrial mechanical function 
lags behind that of electrical systolic function, and thrombi 
can  still  form  in  largely  akinetic  atria,  although  they  are 
electrocardiographically  in  sinus  rhythm.  Exclusion  of  left 
atrial thrombi by transesophageal echocardiography imme-
diately before cardioversion may not always preclude embo-
lism days or weeks after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. 
Atrial  thrombi  can  be  present  in  patients  with  non
fibrillation-related  atrial  tachyarrhythmias,  such  as  atrial 
flutter and AT in patients with congenital heart disease. The 
same precardioversion and postcardioversion anticoagula-
tion recommendations apply to these patients, as well as to 
those with atrial fibrillation. Although direct-current shock 
has  been  demonstrated  in  animals  to  cause  myocardial 
injury, studies in humans have indicated that elevations in 
myocardial  enzymes  after  cardioversion  are  not  common. 
ST-segment  elevation,  sometimes  dramatic,  can  occur 
immediately after elective direct-current cardioversion and 
last for 1 to 2 minutes, although cardiac enzymes and myo-
cardial  scintigraphy  may  be  unremarkable.  ST  elevation 
lasting longer than 2 minutes usually indicates myocardial 
injury unrelated to the shock. A decrease in serum K+ and 
Mg2+ levels can occur after cardioversion of VT.

Cardioversion  of  VT  can  also  be  achieved  by  a  chest 
thump. Its mechanism of termination is probably related to 
a  mechanically  induced  PVC  that  interrupts  a  tachycardia 
circuit and may be related to commotio cordis (see Chapter 
79). The thump cannot be timed very well and is probably 
effective only when delivered during a nonrefractory part of 
the  cardiac  cycle.  The  thump  can  alter  a  VT  and  possibly 
induce ventricular flutter or VF if it occurs during the vulner-
able period of the T wave. Because there may be a slightly 
greater  likelihood  of  converting  a  stable  VT  to  VF  than  of 
terminating VT to sinus rhythm, chest thump cardioversion 
should  not  be  attempted  unless  a  defibrillator  is  simply 
unavailable.

ImplantableElectricalDevicesfor
TreatmentofCardiacArrhythmias
Implantable devices that monitor the cardiac rhythm and can deliver 
competing  pacing  stimuli  and  low-  and  high-energy  shocks  have 
been used effectively in selected patients (see Chapter 36).

AblationTherapyforCardiacArrhythmias
The purpose of catheter ablation is to destroy myocardial tissue by 
delivery of energy, generally electrical energy or cryoenergy, through 
electrodes on a catheter placed next to an area of the myocardium 
integrally  related  to  onset  or  maintenance  of  the  arrhythmia.  For 
tachycardias with an apparent focal origin (e.g., automatic, triggered 
activity,  microreentry),  the  focus  itself  (<5 mm  in  diameter)  is  tar-
geted. In macroreentrant AT and VT, inexcitable scar tissue typically 
separates strands of surviving myocardium, and wave fronts propa-
gate around these scars. The target for ablation is a narrow portion 
of myocardium between inexcitable areas (e.g., scar, valve annulus; 
Fig.  35-2).  The  first  catheter  ablation  procedures  were  performed 
with  direct-current  shocks,  but  this  energy  source  has  been  sup-
planted by radiofrequency (RF) energy, which is delivered from an 
external generator and destroys tissue by controlled heat production. 
Lasers and microwave energy sources have been used, but not com-
monly; cryothermal catheter ablation has been approved for use in 

humans. When a target tissue has been identified by EPS, the tip of 
the ablation catheter is maneuvered into apposition with this tissue. 
After stable catheter position and recordings have been ensured, RF 
energy is delivered between the catheter tip and an indifferent elec-
trode,  usually  an  electrocautery-type  grounding  pad  on  the  skin  of 
the patients thigh. Because energies in the RF portion of the electro-
magnetic  spectrum  are  poorly  conducted  by  cardiac  tissue,  RF 
energy instead causes resistive heating in the cells close to the tip of 
the  catheter  (i.e.,  these  cells  transduce  the  electrical  energy  into 
thermal energy). When tissue temperature exceeds 50°C, irreversible 
cellular damage and tissue death occur. An expanding front of con-
ducted heat emanates from the region of resistive heating while RF 
delivery continues over the next 30 seconds and results in the produc-
tion  of  a  homogeneous,  roughly  hemispheric  lesion  of  coagulative 
necrosis  3  to  5 mm  in  diameter  (Fig.  35-3).  RF-induced  heating  of 
tissue  that  has  inherent  automaticity  (e.g.,  His  bundle,  foci  of  auto-
matic tachycardias) results in initial acceleration of a rhythm, whereas 
RF  delivery  during  a  reentrant  arrhythmia  typically  causes  slowing 
and termination of the arrhythmia. In most cases, RF delivery is pain-
less,  although  ablation  of  atrial  or  right  ventricular  tissue  can  be 
uncomfortable for some patients.

Cooled-Tip  Radiofrequency  Ablation.  In  some  situations  the 
catheter can be delivered to the correct location, but conventional RF 
energy  delivery  cannot  eliminate  the  tachycardia.  In  some  of  these 
cases the amount of damagedepth or breadthcaused by standard 
RF  energy  is  inadequate.  With  the  use  of  standard  RF  energy,   
power delivery is usually regulated to maintain a preset catheter tip

temperature  (typically,  55°C  to  70°C).  Tip  temperatures  higher  than 
90°C are associated with coagulation of blood elements on the elec-
trode, which precludes further energy delivery and could also cause 
these  elements  to  become  detached  and  embolize.  Cooling  of  the 
catheter tip by internal circulation of liquid or continuous fluid infusion 
through small holes in the tip electrode can prevent excessive heating 
of the tip and allow greater delivery of power, thus producing a larger 
lesion  and  potentially  enhancing  efficacy.24  Cooled-tip  ablation  has 
been used to good advantage in cases in which standard (4-mm tip) 
catheter ablation has failed, as well as for primary therapy for atrial 
flutter and fibrillation and VT associated with structural heart disease, 
in which additional damage to already diseased areas is not harmful 
and may be required to achieve the desired result.

Catheter-delivered  cryoablation  causes  tissue  damage  by  freezing 
cellular structures. Nitrous oxide is delivered to the tip of the catheter, 
where it is allowed to boil and cool the tip electrode, after which the 
gas is circulated back to the delivery console. Catheter tip temperature 
can  be  regulated,  with  cooling  to  as  low  as 80°C.  Cooling  to  0°C 
causes reversible loss of function and can be used as a diagnostic test 
(i.e.,  termination  of  a  tachycardia  when  the  catheter  is  in  contact   
with  a  group  of  cells  critical  to  its  perpetuation  or  determining  its 
effect on normal conduction when close to the AV node). The catheter 
tip can then be cooled more deeply to produce permanent damage 
and  thus  cure  of  the  arrhythmia.  Cryoablation  has  been  used  for 
pulmonary vein isolation to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by situat-
ing a collapsed balloon at the end of a catheter near a pulmonary vein 
ostium and inflating the balloon with nitrous oxide at 80°C. During 
cryoballoon occlusion of the vein for 3 to 4 minutes at a time, pulmo-
nary vein isolation can usually be effected with one or two applica-
tions.25 Real-time recordings can be done simultaneously to monitor 
conduction. Cryoablation appears to cause less endocardial damage 
than  RF  energy  does  and  may  thus  engender  less  risk  for  thrombo-
emboli after ablation, as well as less chance of esophageal injury with 
ablation  of  atrial  fibrillation  (although  not  eliminated);  however, 
balloon cryotherapy to isolate right pulmonary veins for the treatment 
of atrial fibrillation has resulted in phrenic nerve injury, and care must 
be  taken  to  establish  the  location  of  the  phrenic  nerve.  Residual 
arrhythmias can result (Videos 35-1 and 35-2).

Radiofrequency  Catheter  Ablation  of  Accessory  Pathways. 
Location  of  Pathways.  The  safety,  efficacy,  and  cost-effectiveness 
of RF catheter ablation of an accessory AV pathway have made abla-
tion the treatment of choice in most adult and many pediatric patients 
who have AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) or atrial flutter or fibrilla-
tion  associated  with  a  rapid  ventricular  response  over  the  accessory 
pathway (see Chapter 37). When RF energy is delivered to an imma-
ture heart, the lesion size can increase as the heart grows; however, 
this has not been shown to cause problems later in life.

An  EPS  is  performed  initially  to  determine  that  the  accessory 
pathway is part of the tachycardia circuit or capable of rapid AV con-
duction during atrial fibrillation and to localize the accessory pathway, 
the  optimal  site  for  ablation.  Pathways  can  exist  in  the  right  or  left 
free  wall  or  the  septum  of  the  heart  (Fig.  35-4).  Septal  accessory 
pathways  are  further  classified  as  superoparaseptal,  midseptal,  and 
posteroseptal.  Pathways  classified  as  posteroseptal  are  posterior  to

the central fibrous body within the so-called pyramidal space, which 
is bounded by the posterior superior process of the left ventricle and 
the inferomedial aspects of both atria. Superoparaseptal pathways are 
found near the His bundle, and accessory pathway activation potential 
as well as His bundle potential can be recorded simultaneously from 
a  catheter  placed  at  the  His  bundle  region.  Midseptal  pathways  are 
close to the AV node and can usually be ablated from a right-sided 
approach; rarely, a left atrial approach is needed. Right posteroseptal 
pathways insert along the tricuspid ring in the vicinity of the coronary 
sinus ostium, whereas left posteroseptal pathways are further into the 
coronary sinus and may be located at a subepicardial site around the 
proximal coronary sinus, within a middle cardiac vein or coronary sinus 
diverticulum, or subendocardially along the ventricular aspect of the 
mitral annulus.

Pathways  at  all  locations  and  in  all  age  groups  can  be  ablated   
successfully. Multiple pathways are present in about 5% of patients. 
Occasional  pathways  with  epicardial  locations  may  be  more  easily 
approached  from  within  the  coronary  sinus.  Rarely,  pathways  can 
connect  an  atrial  appendage  with  adjacent  ventricular  epicardium, 
2 cm or more from the AV groove.

Ablation  Site.  The  optimal  ablation  site  can  be  found  by  direct 
recordings of the accessory pathway (Fig. 35-5), although deflections 
that  mimic  accessory  pathway  potentials  can  be  recorded  at  other 
sites. The ventricular insertion site can be determined by finding the 
site of the earliest onset of the ventricular electrogram in relation to 
the onset of the delta wave. Other helpful guidelines include unfiltered 
unipolar recordings that register a QS wave and an accessory pathway 
signal during preexcitation. A major ventricular potential synchronous 
with onset of the delta wave can be a target site in left-sided preex-
citation, whereas earlier ventricular excitation in relation to the delta 
wave can be found for right-sided preexcitation. The atrial insertion 
site  of  manifest  or  concealed  pathways  (i.e.,  delta  wave  present  or 
absent,  respectively)  can  be  found  by  locating  the  site  showing  the 
earliest  atrial  activation  during  retrograde  conduction  over  the 
pathway.  Reproducible  mechanical  inhibition  of  accessory  pathway 
conduction  during  catheter  manipulation  and  subthreshold  stimula-
tion  has  also  been  used  to  determine  the  optimal  site.  Accidental 
catheter trauma should be avoided, however, because it can hide the 
target  for  prolonged  periods.  Right  free  wall  and  superoparaseptal 
pathways are particularly susceptible to catheter trauma.

Left-sided  accessory  pathways  typically  cross  the  mitral  annulus 
obliquely. Consequently, the earliest site of retrograde atrial activation 
and  the  earliest  site  of  anterograde  ventricular  activation  are  not 
directly across the AV groove from each other (i.e., ventricular inser-
tion closer to coronary sinus ostium). Identification of the earliest site 
of atrial activation is usually performed during orthodromic AVRT or 
relatively rapid ventricular pacing so that retrograde conduction using 
the AV node does not confuse assessment of the location of the earli-
est atrial activation.

Successful ablation sites should exhibit stable fluoroscopic and elec-
trical characteristics. During sinus rhythm, local ventricular activation 
at  the  successful  ablation  site  precedes  onset  of  the  delta  wave  on 
the  ECG  by  10  to  35  milliseconds;  during  orthodromic  AVRT,  the 
interval between onset of ventricular activation in any lead and local 
atrial activation is usually 70 to 90 milliseconds (see Fig. 35-5). When 
temperature-measuring  ablation  catheters  are  used,  a  stable  rise  in 
catheter tip temperature is a helpful indicator of catheter stability and 
adequate contact between the electrode and tissue. In such a case,

rowhead) and instead is conducted over the AV node and bundle of His and resulted 
in a narrow QRS complex and started an episode of AVRT. After each narrow QRS 
complex is an atrial deflection, the earliest portion of which is recorded at the ablation 
site (green arrowheads). B, Ablation of this pathway by delivery of RF energy from the

tip  temperature  generally  exceeds  50°C.  The  retrograde  transaortic 
and  transseptal  approaches  have  been  used  with  equal  success  to 
ablate accessory pathways located along the mitral annulus. Routine 
performance  of  an  EPS  weeks  after  the  ablation  procedure  is  not 
generally  indicated  but  may  be  considered  in  patients  who  have  a 
recurrent delta wave or symptoms of tachycardia. Catheter-delivered 
cryoablation can be useful in patients with septal accessory pathways 
(located near the AV node or His bundle). With use of this system, the 
catheter  tip  and  adjacent  tissue  can  be  reversibly  cooled  to  test  a 
potential site. If accessory pathway conduction fails while normal AV 
conduction is preserved, deeper cooling can be performed at the site 
to complete the ablation. If, however, normal AV conduction is wors-
ened, permanent damage is almost always averted by quickly allowing 
the catheter to rewarm.

Atriofascicular accessory pathways have connections consisting of 
a proximal, AV nodelike portion, which is responsible for conduction 

delay  and  decremental  conduction  properties,  and  a  long  distal 
segment located along the endocardial surface of the right ventricular 
free wall, which has electrophysiologic properties similar to those of 
the  right  bundle  branch.  The  distal  end  of  the  right  atriofascicular 
accessory pathway can insert into the apical region of the right ven-
tricular free wall, close to the distal right bundle branch, or can actually 
fuse  with  the  latter.  Right  atriofascicular  accessory  pathways  might 
represent a duplication of the AV conduction system and can be local-
ized for ablation by recording potentials from the rapidly conducting 
distal component, which crosses the tricuspid annulus (analogous to 
the His bundle) and extends to the apical region of the right ventricular 
free wall. Ablation at such a site on the annulus is usually successful; 
these pathways are very sensitive to catheter trauma, and the operator 
must use great care to avoid such trauma.

Indications
Ablation  of  accessory  pathways  is  indicated  in  patients  who  have 
symptomatic AVRT that is drug resistant or who are drug intolerant 
or do not desire long-term drug therapy. It is also indicated in patients 
who  have  atrial  fibrillation  or  other  atrial  tachyarrhythmias  and  a 
rapid ventricular response by means of an accessory pathway when 
the tachycardia is drug resistant or in those who are drug intolerant 
or do not desire long-term drug therapy. Other potential candidates 
with an accessory pathway include the following: (1) patients with 
AVRT or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates identified during 
an EPS for another arrhythmia; (2) asymptomatic patients with ven-
tricular preexcitation whose livelihood, profession, important activi-
ties, insurability, or mental well-being and the publics safety would 
be affected by spontaneous tachyarrhythmias or by the presence of 
the electrocardiographic abnormality; (3) patients with atrial fibrilla-
tion and a controlled ventricular response by means of the accessory 
pathway;  and  (4)  patients  with  a  family  history  of  sudden  cardiac 
death. Controversy remains whether all patients with accessory path-
ways need treatment; however, ablation has such a high success rate 
and  low  complication  rate  that  in  most  centers,  patients  who  need 
any form of therapy are referred for catheter ablation.

Results
Currently, in the hands of an experienced operator, the success rate 
for accessory pathway ablation is greater than 95% (slightly less for 
right  free  wall  pathways,  in  which  stable  catheter-tissue  contact  is 
more  problematic),  with  a  2%  recurrence  rate  after  an  apparently 
successful procedure. There is a 1% to 2% complication rate, includ-
ing bleeding, vascular damage, myocardial perforation with cardiac 
tamponade, valve damage, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Heart 
block occurs in less than 3% of septal pathways. Procedure-related 
death is very rare.

Radiofrequency Catheter Modification of the 
Atrioventricular Node for Atrioventricular Nodal 
Reentrant Tachycardias
AV node reentry is a common cause of SVT episodes (see Chapters 
33 and 37). Although controversy still exists about the exact nature 
of the tachycardia circuit, abundant evidence has indicated that two 
pathways in the region of the AV node participate, one with relatively 
fast  conduction  but  long  refractoriness  and  the  other  with  shorter 
refractoriness  but  slower  conduction.  Premature  atrial  contractions 
can encounter refractoriness in the fast pathway, conduct down the 
slow  pathway,  and  reenter  the  fast  pathway  retrogradely,  thereby 
initiating  AV  nodal  reentrant  SVT  (Fig.  35-6).  Although  this  is  the 
most common manifestation of AV node reentry, some patients have 
what  appears  to  be  propagation  in  the  opposite  direction  in  this 
circuit  (anterograde  fast,  retrograde  slow),  as  well  as  a  slow-slow 
variant. Other, far less common types have been described. Two or 
more of these variants can exist in the same patient (Fig. 35-7).

Fast  Pathway  Ablation.  Ablation  can  be  performed  to  eliminate 
conduction  in  the  fast  pathway  or  the  slow  pathway.  Currently,  fast 
pathway  ablation  is  rarely  performed  because  it  is  associated  with  a

FIGURE35-6  AV node reentry. A, Two atrial paced complexes from the coronary sinus (CS) are followed by an atrial premature stimulus at a coupling interval of 260 millisec-
onds and resulted in an A-H interval of 145 milliseconds. B, The same atrial drive train is followed by an atrial extrastimulus 10 milliseconds earlier than before (250 milliseconds). 
This resulted in a marked increase in the A-H interval to 210 milliseconds, after which AVNRT ensues because the extrastimulus encounters block in a fast AV node pathway, 
conducts down a slow pathway, and then conducts back up the fast pathway in a repeating fashion. Red arrowheads denote atrial electrograms coincident with QRS com-
plexes, characteristic of the most common type of AV node reentry. Recording was done as in previous figures.

ablation may be preferred is for patients who have a markedly prolonged 
PR interval at rest and no evidence of anterograde fast pathway conduc-
tion.  In  such  cases,  ablation  of  the  anterograde  slow  pathway  may 
produce complete AV block, whereas retrograde fast pathway ablation 
can eliminate SVT without altering AV conduction.

Slow  Pathway  Ablation.  The  slow  pathway  can  be  located  by 
mapping  along  the  posteromedial  tricuspid  annulus  close  to  the   
coronary  sinus  os.  Electrographic  recordings  are  obtained  with  an 
atrial-to-ventricular  electrogram  ratio  of  less  than  0.5  and  either  a 
multicomponent  atrial  electrogram  or  a  recording  of  possible  slow 
pathway potential. In the anatomic approach, target sites are selected 
fluoroscopically. A single RF application eliminates slow pathway con-
duction in many cases, but in others, serial RF lesions may be needed, 
starting  at  the  most  posterior  site  (near  the  coronary  sinus  os)  and 
progressing to the more anterior locus (closer to the His bundle record-
ing site). An accelerated junctional rhythm (Fig. 35-8) usually occurs 
when RF energy is applied at a site that will result in successful elimi-
nation of SVT. The success rate is equivalent with the anatomic and 
electrographic  mapping  approaches,  and  most  often,  combinations 
of both are used and yield success rates approaching 100%, with less 
than a 1% chance of complete heart block. Catheter-delivered cryo-
ablation  has  been  used  for  the  treatment  of  AVNRT  with  excellent 
results and is considered by some to be safer than RF (less chance of 
permanent  AV  block)  but  in  most  series  has  a  higher  rate  of  SVT 
recurrence after apparent successful ablation.

Slow pathway ablation results in an increase in the anterograde AV 
block  cycle  length  and  AV  node  ERP  without  a  change  in  the  A-H 
interval or retrograde conduction properties of the AV node. Patients 
in  whom  slow  pathway  conduction  is  completely  eliminated  almost 
never  have  recurrent  SVT  episodes;  approximately  40%  of  patients 
can have evidence of residual slow pathway function after successful 
elimination of sustained AVNRT, usually manifested as persistent dual
AV node physiology and singleAV node echoes during atrial extra-
stimulation.  The  surest  endpoint  for  slow  pathway  ablation  is 
elimination  of  sustained  AVNRT,  with  and  without  an  infusion  of 
isoproterenol.

AVNRT recurs in approximately 5% of patients after slow pathway 
ablation;  repeated  ablation  is  almost  always  successful.  In  some 
patients, the ERP of the fast pathway decreases after slow pathway 
ablation,  possibly  because  of  electrotonic  interaction  between  the 
two pathways. Atypical forms of reentry can result after ablation, as 

can apparent parasympathetic denervation, and result in inappropri-
ate sinus tachycardia.

At present, the slow pathway approach is the preferred method for 
ablation of typical AVNRT. Ablation of the slow pathway is also a safe 
and effective means for the treatment of atypical forms of AVNRT. In 
patients  with  AVNRT  undergoing  slow  pathway  ablation,  junctional 
ectopy during application of the RF energy is a sensitive but nonspe-
cific marker of successful ablation; it occurs in longer bursts at effec-
tive  target  sites  than  at  ineffective  sites.  Ventriculoatrial  conduction 
should be expected during the junctional ectopy, and poor ventricu-
loatrial  conduction  or  actual  block  may  herald  subsequent  antero-
grade AV block. Junctional ectopic rhythm is caused by heating of the 
AV node and does not occur with cryoablation.

Indications
RF catheter ablation for AVNRT can be considered in patients with 
recurrent,  symptomatic,  sustained  AVNRT  that  is  drug  resistant  or 
who are drug intolerant or do not desire long-term drug treatment. 
The  procedure  can  also  be  considered  for  patients  with  sustained 
AVNRT identified during EPS or catheter ablation of another arrhyth-
mia or when there is a finding of dualAV node pathway physiology 
and  atrial  echoes  but  without  AVNRT  during  EPS  in  patients  sus-
pected of having AVNRT clinically.

Results
Most centers currently use slow pathway ablation, which results in a 
procedural success rate of 98%, a recurrence rate of less than 2%, and 
an incidence of heart block requiring permanent pacing of 1% or less.

Ectopic Junctional Tachycardia
Ectopic junctional tachycardia is a rare form of SVT in which the ECG 
resembles that in AVNRT but is distinct in that (1) the mechanism is 
automatic, not reentrant and (2) the atrium is clearly not involved in 
the tachycardia. This disorder is most commonly observed in young 
healthy individuals, in women more often than in men, and is usually 
catecholamine dependent. Ablation must be carried out close to the 
His bundle, and the risk for heart block requiring pacemaker inser-
tion exceeds 5%.

FIGURE35-8  AV node slow pathway modification for cure of AV node reentrant SVT. The ablation recording (ar-
rowhead  in  Abl1-2)  shows  a  slurred  deflection  between  the  atrial  and  ventricular  electrogram  components;  this  may 
represent the AV node slow pathway deflection (but it is not the bundle of His deflection, which is instead recorded from 
a separate catheter 15 mm away). Shortly after the onset of RF delivery (arrowhead in RFWatts), an accelerated junctional 
rhythm begins and gradually speeds up further. Retrograde conduction is present during the junctional rhythm. Abl3-4 = 
proximal electrode recording from ablation catheter. Recording was done as in previous figures. 

Radiofrequency Catheter 
Ablation of Arrhythmias  
Related to the Sinus Node
Reentry in or around the sinus node is an 
extremely  uncommon  arrhythmia  char-
acterized  by  episodes  of  tachycardia 
with  a  P  wave  identical  to  the  sinus  P 
wave,  usually  with  a  PR  interval  longer 
than in sinus; in physiologic sinus tachy-
cardia, the PR interval remains normal or 
shortens  because  of  similar  catechol-
amine effects on the sinus and AV nodes. 
RF energy is applied around the region of 
the sinus node at sites of early activation, 
before  onset  of  the  P  wave,  until  the 
tachycardia terminates.

Inappropriate  sinus  tachycardia  is  a 
syndrome  characterized  by  high  sinus 
rates  with  exercise  and  at  rest.  Patients 
complain of palpitations at all times of day 
that  correlate  with  inappropriately  high 
sinus rates. They may not respond well to 
beta blocker therapy because of lack of 
desired  effect  or  occurrence  of  side 
effects. When the sinus node area is to be 
ablated, it can be identified anatomically 
and  electrophysiologically,  and  ablative 
lesions  are  usually  placed  between  the 
superior vena cava and crista terminalis 
at sites of early atrial activation.Intracar-
in  
diac  echocardiography  can  help 

defining the anatomy and in positioning the ablation catheter. Isopro-
terenol may be helpful in forcing the site of impulse formation to cells 
with the most rapid discharge rate. Care must be taken to apply RF 
energy  at  the  most  cephalad  sites  first;  initial  ablation  performed 
farther down the crista terminalis does not alter the atrial rate at the 
time but can damage any subsidiary pacemaker regions that may be 
needed after the sinus node has eventually been ablated.

Indications
Catheter ablation for paroxysmal sinus node reentrant tachycardia can 
be performed in patients who have recurrent symptomatic episodes of 
sustained SVT that is drug resistant or who are drug intolerant or do 
not desire long-term drug treatment. Patients with persistent inappro-
priate sinus tachycardia should be considered for ablation only after 
clear  failure  of  medical  therapy  because  the  results  of  ablation  are 
often  less  than  completely  satisfactory.  Whenever  ablation  is  per-
formed in the region of the sinus node, the patient should be apprised 
of  the  chance  of  needing  a  pacemaker  after  the  procedure.  Phrenic 
nerve damage and superior vena caval stenosis are also possibilities.

Results
Sinus node reentrant tachycardia can be ablated successfully in more 
than  90%  of  patients.  The  results  are  not  as  good  for  inappropriate 
sinus tachycardia; although a good technical result may be obtained 
at the time of the procedure, symptoms often persist because of recur-
rence of rapid sinus rates (at or near preablation rates) or for nonar-
rhythmic  reasons.  In  some,  after  the  atrial  rate  decreases,  an 
inappropriately rapid junctional rhythm (80 to 90/min) is present; this 
may point to an overall increased sensitivity of cells with pacemaker 
capacity to catecholamines in these patients. Multiple ablation ses-
sions are needed in some patients, and approximately 20% eventually 
undergo  pacemaker  implantation;  however,  not  all  these  patients 
have relief of palpitations despite a normal heart rate.

Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation of Atrial Tachycardia
ATs are a heterogeneous group of disorders; causative factors include 
rapid  discharge  of  a  focus  (focal  tachycardia)  and  reentry.  The 
former can occur in anyone, irrespective of the presence of structural 
abnormalities of the atria, whereas reentrant ATs almost always occur 
in  the  setting  of  structurally  damaged  atria.  Symptoms  vary  from 
none, with relatively infrequent or slow ATs in patients without heart 
disease, to syncope (rapid AT with compromised cardiac function) 
or heart failure (incessant AT during a period of weeks or months). 
All forms of AT are amenable to catheter ablation (see Chapter 37).

Focal Atrial Tachycardia.  In focal ATs (automatic or triggered foci 
or microreentry), activation mapping is used to determine the site of 
the AT by recording the earliest onset of local activation. These tachy-
cardias can behave capriciously and be practically noninducible during 
EPS despite the patient complaining of multiple daily episodes before 
the EPS. Approximately 10% of patients can have multiple atrial foci. 
Sites tend to cluster near the pulmonary veins in the left atrium and 
the mouths of the atrial appendages and along the crista terminalis 
on the right (Figs. 35-9A and 35-10; also see Fig. 34-14). Activation 
times at these sites typically occur only 15 to 40 milliseconds before 
onset of the P wave on the ECG. Care must be taken to avoid inad-
vertent damage to the phrenic nerve; its location can be determined 
by pacing at high current at a candidate site of ablation while observ-
ing for diaphragmatic contraction. Ablation should not be performed 
at a site at which this is seen, if at all possible.

Reentrant  Atrial  Tachycardia.  As  noted,  these  ATs  occur  more 
commonly  in  the  setting  of  structural  heart  disease,  especially  after 
previous surgery involving an atrial incision (repair of congenital heart 
disease such as an atrial septal defect, Mustard or Senning repair of 
transposed  great  vessels,  or  one  of  a  variety  of  Fontan  repairs  for 
tricuspid atresia and other disorders) or previous atrial ablation (e.g., 
for atrial fibrillation). The region of slow conduction is typically related 
to an end of an atriotomy or previous ablation scar, the location of 
which  varies  from  patient  to  patient. 
Therefore,  preprocedural  review  of 
operative  and  ablation  procedure 
reports  and  careful  electrophysiologic 
mapping are essential. Because reentry 
within  a  complete  circuit  is  occurring, 
activation can be recorded throughout 
the  entire  cardiac  cycle.  The  ablation 
strategy is to identify regions with mid-
diastolic atrial activation during tachy-
cardia (Fig. 35-11; also see Fig. 35-9B) 
that  can  be  proved  by  pacing  tech-
niques  to  be  integral  to  the  tachycar-
dia.  Such  sites  are  attractive  ablation 
targets because they are composed of 
relatively  few  cellshence,  electrical 
silence on the surface ECG in diastole
and are thus more easily eliminated by  
the small amount of damage effected 
by  a  typical  application  of  RF  energy 
than other areas might be. Focal abla-
tion  of  these  sites  can  then  be  per-
formed, but often tachycardia can still 
be initiated (usually at a slower rate) or 
recurs  after  the  procedure.  Because 
these  sites  are  typically  located  at  a 
relatively  narrow  zone  between  the 
ends  of  previous  scars,  surgical  inci-
sions,  or  ablation  lines  and  another

FIGURE 35-11  Reentrant  AT.  Left,  An  electroanatomic  activation  map  of  the 
right atrium is shown in a patient with a previous right atrial incision for closure of 
an atrial septal defect. Scar is shown as gray areas; arrows depict a double loop of 
reentry around scars with a common diastolic pathway between scars. The color bar 
at center shows progression of activation times during AT (from red through green, 
blue, and purple). The tachycardia cycle length (350 milliseconds) is almost entirely 
represented in the range of colors. Right, Red dots are ablation sites connecting scars 
(transecting diastolic pathway) and connecting one scar to the inferior vena cava (IVC) 
to preclude reentry around all barriers. His = His bundle; SVC = superior vena cava; 
TV = tricuspid valve. 

nonconducting barrier (e.g., another scar, caval orifice, valve annulus), 
another technique is to make a line of ablative lesions from the end 
of  the  scar  to  the  nearest  electrical  barrier.  Reentry  can  thereby  be 
prevented.  This  technique  is  analogous  to  that  used  in  curing  atrial 
flutter  (see  later).  Because  these  patients  frequently  have  extensive 
atrial disease with islands of scar that could serve as barriers for addi-
tional ATs, specialized mapping techniques may be needed to locate 
these regions and preemptively connect them with ablative lesions to 
prevent future AT episodes.

Indications
Catheter ablation for ATs should be considered in patients who have 
recurrent episodes of symptomatic sustained ATs that are drug resis-
tant  or  who  are  drug  intolerant  or  do  not  desire  long-term  drug 
treatment.

Results
Success rates for ablation of focal AT range from 80% to 95%, largely 
depending on the ability to induce episodes at EPS; when episodes 
can be initiated with pacing, isoproterenol, or other means, the AT 
can usually be ablated. Reentrant ATs, although more readily induced 
by  an  EPS,  are  often  more  difficult  to  eliminate  completely;  initial 
success rates are high (90%), but recurrences are seen in up to 20% 
of patients and necessitate drug therapy or another ablation proce-
dure.  Complications,  which  occur  in  1%  to  2%  of  patients,  include 
phrenic  nerve  damage,  cardiac  tamponade,  and  heart  block  (with 
rare perinodal ATs).

Radiofrequency  Catheter  Ablation  of  Atrial  Flutter.  Atrial 
flutter may be defined electrocardiographically (most typically, nega-
tive sawtooth waves in leads II, III, and aVF at a rate of approximately 
300  beats/min)  or  electrophysiologically  (a  rapid,  organized  macro-
reentrant AT, the circuit for which is anatomically determined). Under-
standing  of  the  reentrant  pathway  in  all  forms  of  atrial  flutter  is 
essential for development of an ablation strategy (see Chapter 37). 
Reentry  in  the  right  atrium,  with  the  left  atrium  passively  activated, 
constitutes  the  mechanism  of  the  typical  electrocardiographic   
variety  of  atrial  flutter,  with  caudocranial  activation  along  the  right 
atrial septum and craniocaudal activation of the right atrial free wall 

(Fig.  35-12A).  Ablating  tissue  in  a  line  between  any  two  anatomic 
barriers that transects a portion of the circuit necessary for perpetu-
ation of reentry can be curative. Typically, this is across the isthmus of 
atrial tissue between the inferior vena caval orifice and the tricuspid 
annulus  (the  cavotricuspid  isthmus),  a  relatively  narrow  point  in  the 
circuit.  Successful  ablation  can  be  accomplished  at  the  point  where 
the advancing flutter wave front enters this zone in the low inferolat-
eral right atrium, near the exit of this zone at the inferomedial right 
atrium,  or  in  between  these  sites.  Locations  for  RF  delivery  can  be 
guided  anatomically  or  electrophysiologically.  Less  commonly,  the 
direction of wave front propagation in this large right atrial circuit is 
reversed (clockwise flutter proceeding cephalad up the right atrial 
free wall and caudad down the septum with upright flutter waves in 
the  inferior  leads;  Fig.  35-12A,  right  panel).  This  arrhythmia,  which 
has been called atypical atrial flutter, can also be ablated by the same 
techniques as used for more typical atrial flutter. These two arrhyth-
mias constitute cavotricuspid isthmusdependent flutter and are dis-
tinct  from  other  rapid  atrial  arrhythmias  that  may  have  a  similar 
appearance on the ECG but use different (and often multiple) circuits 
in other parts of the right or left atrium. Ablation can be more difficult 
in  these  cases,  which  often  occur  in  the  setting  of  advanced  lung 
disease or previous cardiac surgery or ablation. A common theme in 
these complex reentrant arrhythmias is the presence of an anatomi-
cally determined zone of inexcitability around which an electrical wave 
front can circulate. Specialized mapping tools and skills are necessary 
to achieve successful ablation in these cases.

In patients with atrial fibrillation, an antiarrhythmic drug can slow 
intra-atrial conduction to such an extent that atrial flutter results and 
fibrillation is no longer observed. In some of these patients, ablation 
of atrial flutter and having them continue to take the antiarrhythmic 
drug can prevent recurrences of these atrial arrhythmias.

The endpoint of atrial flutter ablation procedures was initially ter-
mination of atrial flutter, with RF application accompanied by nonin-
ducibility  of  the  arrhythmia.  However,  with  use  of  these  criteria,  up 
to 30% of patients had recurrent flutter because of lack of complete 
and permanent conduction block in the cavotricuspid isthmus. In the 
last several years the endpoint of ablation has changed to ensuring a 
line of bidirectional block in this region by pacing from opposite sides 
of the isthmus (Fig. 35-12B) or the use of other techniques. With use 
of these criteria, recurrence rates have fallen to less than 5%.

Indications
Candidates for RF catheter ablation include patients with recurrent 
episodes of atrial flutter that are drug resistant, those who are drug 
intolerant, and those who do not desire long-term drug therapy. Many 
patients  who  undergo  atrial  fibrillation  ablation  (see  Chapter  38) 
also have episodes of flutter during the procedure that can be treated 
by ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus at the same setting.

Results
Regardless  of  circuit  location,  atrial  flutter  can  be  ablated  success-
fully in more than 90% of cases, although patients with complex right 
or left atrial flutter require more extensive and complex procedures. 
Recurrence rates are lower than 5% except in patients with extensive 
atrial disease, in whom new circuits can develop over time as new 
areas  of  conduction  delay  and  block  form.  Complications  are  rare 
and include inadvertent heart block and phrenic nerve paralysis.

Ablation and Modification of Atrioventricular 
Conduction for Atrial Tachyarrhythmias
In  some  patients  who  have  rapid  ventricular  rates  despite  optimal 
drug  therapy  during  complex  atrial  tachyarrhythmias  that  are  less 
amenable  to  ablation,  RF  ablation  can  be  used  to  eliminate  or  to 
modify AV conduction and control the ventricular rates. To achieve 
this, a catheter is placed across the tricuspid valve and positioned to 
record a small His bundle electrogram associated with a large atrial 
electrogram. RF energy is applied until complete AV block has been 
achieved and is continued for an additional 30 to 60 seconds (Fig. 
35-13). If no change in AV conduction is observed after 15 seconds 
of RF ablation despite good contact, the catheter is repositioned and 
the attempt repeated. In occasional patients, attempts at RF ablation 
via this right-sided heart approach fail to achieve heart block. These

FIGURE35-12  A, Two forms of atrial flutter in the same patient are shown. A halo catheter with 10 electrode pairs is situated on the atrial side of the tricuspid annulus 
(TA), with recording sites displayed from the top of the annulus (12:00) to the inferomedial aspect (5:00), as shown in the fluoroscopic views in B. On the left, the wave front 
of atrial activation proceeds in a clockwise fashion (arrows) along the annulus, whereas on the right, the direction of propagation is the reverse. B, Ablation of the isthmus of 
atrial tissue between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena caval orifice for cure of atrial flutter. Recordings are displayed from the multipolar catheter around much of the 
circumference of the tricuspid annulus (see the left anterior oblique fluoroscopic images). Ablation of this isthmus is performed during coronary sinus pacing. In the two beats on 
the left, atrial conduction proceeds in two directions around the tricuspid annulus, as indicated by arrows and recorded along the halo catheter. In the two beats on the right, 
ablation has interrupted conduction in the floor of the right atrium, thereby eliminating one path for transmission along the tricuspid annulus. The halo catheter now records 
conduction, proceeding all the way around the annulus. This finding demonstrates a unidirectional block in the isthmus; block in the other direction may be demonstrated by 
pacing from one of the halo electrodes and observing a similar lack of isthmus conduction. (The bundle of His recording in the right panel is lost because of catheter movement.)

patients can undergo an attempt from the left ventricle with a cath-
eter  positioned  along  the  posterior  interventricular  septum,  just 
beneath the aortic valve, to record a large His bundle electrogram. 
Energy is applied between the catheter electrode and skin patch or 
between catheters in the left and right ventricles. Success rates cur-
rently approach 100%, with AV conduction recurring in less than 5% 
of cases. Improved left ventricular function can result from control 
of the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation and withdrawal of rate-
controlling  medications  with  negative  inotropic  action.  Permanent 
ventricular or AV pacing is required after ablation. With continuing 
advances in direct ablation of complex atrial arrhythmias, AV nodal 
ablation is less commonly used currently.

In some cases the AV junction can be modified to slow the ventricular 
rate without producing a complete AV block by ablation in the region 
of the slow pathway, as described in connection with AV node modi-
fication  for  AV  node  reentry.  Initial  success  rates  for  slowing  of  the 
ventricular  response  are  good;  however,  long-term  results  are  less 
consistent.  Some  patients  have  a  gradual  increase  in  the  ventricular 
rate to almost preablation levels, whereas late complete heart block 
may occur in others. Nonetheless, this procedure can be tried before 
producing a complete AV block.

Indications
Ablation  and  modification  of  AV  conduction  can  be  considered  
in the following cases: (1) patients with symptomatic atrial tachyar-
rhythmias who have inadequately controlled ventricular rates unless 
primary ablation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia is possible (especially 
when  a  permanent  pacemaker  is  already  present  for  treatment  of 
bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome); (2) similar patients when drugs 
are not tolerated or patients do not wish to take them, even though 
the ventricular rate can be controlled; (3) patients with symptomatic, 
nonparoxysmal  junctional  tachycardia  that  is  drug  resistant  or  in 
whom drugs are not tolerated or are not desired; (4) patients resus-
citated  from  sudden  cardiac  death  related  to  atrial  flutter  or  atrial 
fibrillation  with  a  rapid  ventricular  response  in  the  absence  of  an 
accessory pathway; and (5) patients with a dual-chamber pacemaker 
and a pacemaker-mediated tachycardia that cannot be treated effec-
tively by drugs or by reprogramming of the pacemaker. The last three 
situations are rarely encountered.

Results
As  noted  before,  successful  interruption  of  AV  conduction  can  be 
achieved in almost all cases; recurrent conduction is observed in less 
than 5%. Significant complications occur in 1% to 2%. In early studies, 
up to 4% of patients had an episode of sudden death after AV junction 
ablation despite adequate pacemaker function, presumably because 

of  relative  bradycardia  after  long  periods  of  rapid  ventricular  rates 
serving  as  the  setting  for  repolarization-related  ventricular  arrhyth-
mias. Since then, backup pacing rates are set to 80 to 90/min for the 
first  1  to  3  months  after  ablation  in  most  cases,  which  has  almost 
entirely  eliminated  this  problem.  Improvements  in  quality-of-life 
indices, as well as in cost-effectiveness, have been demonstrated for 
this procedure.

Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation of  
Ventricular Tachycardia
In general, the success rate for ablation of VTs is slightly lower than 
that for AV node reentry or AV reentry. This lower success rate may 
be  related  to  the  fact  that  this  procedure  is  often  a  last  resort  in 
patients with drug-resistant VT and extensive structural heart disease, 
but it is also related to more difficult mapping in the ventricles. Fur-
thermore, in the ideal case, induction of the VT must be reproducible, 
with  uniform  QRS  morphology  from  beat  to  beat,  and  VT  must  be 
sustained and hemodynamically stable so that the patient can toler-
ate the VT long enough during the procedure to undergo the exten-
sive  mapping  necessary  to  localize  optimal  ablation  target  sites. 
Patients with several electrocardiographically distinct, uniform mor-
phologies of VT can still be candidates for ablation because in many 
cases  a  common  reentrant  pathway  is  shared  by  two  or  more  VT 
morphologies.  Also,  the  target  for  ablation  must  be  fairly  circum-
scribed and preferably endocardially situated, although cases of suc-
cessful ablation only from the epicardial aspect have become more 
common.  Very  rapid  VT,  polymorphic  VT,  and  infrequent,  nonsus-
tained episodes are less well suited to this form of therapy at this time 
(see later).

Location and Ablation.  RF catheter ablation of VT can be divided 
into idiopathic VT, which occurs in patients with essentially structurally 
normal hearts; VT that occurs in various disease settings but without 
coronary  artery  disease;  and  VT  in  patients  with  coronary  artery 
disease and usually previous myocardial infarction. In the first group, 
VTs  can  arise  in  either  ventricle.  Right  ventricular  tachycardias  most 
commonly originate in the outflow tract and have a characteristic left 
bundle branch blocklike, inferior axis morphology (see Chapter 37); 
less often, VTs arise in the inflow tract or free wall. Initiation of tachy-
cardia can often be facilitated by catecholamines. Most left VTs are 
septal in origin and have a characteristic QRS configuration (i.e., right 
bundle  branch  block,  superior  axis);  other  VTs  occur  less  commonly 
and arise from different areas of the left ventricle, including the left 
ventricular  outflow  tract  and  the  aortic  sinuses  of  Valsalva,  and  are 
similar  in  electrocardiographic  appearance  and  clinical  behavior  to 

FIGURE35-14  VT and pace mapping. All 12 surface ECG leads are shown, along with intracardiac recordings during VT. 
The Abl1-2 recording shows a small deflection occurring early in electrical diastole (arrowhead) 110 milliseconds before onset of 
the QRS (dashed line). In the right panel, pacing is performed from this site. This produces an identical QRS complex in each 
lead, with a stimulus-QRS onset interval similar to the electrogram-QRS onset interval during VT. Ablation at this site eliminated 
VT in 2 seconds. RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract.

patients  with  structurally  normal 
hearts  because  of 
the  altered 
anatomy  and  electrophysiology. 
Pace mapping has even lower sensi-
tivity  and  specificity  than  for  idio-
pathic  VT.  Furthermore,  reentry 
circuits can sometimes be large and 
resistant  to  the  relatively  small 
lesions produced by RF catheter abla-
tion in scarred endocardium.

In scar-based VT (e.g., after infarc-
tion, cardiomyopathies), finding of a 
protected region of diastolic activa-
tion  used  as  a  critical  part  of  the 
reentrant circuit is desirable because 
ablation  at  this  site  has  a  good 
chance of eliminating the tachycar-
dia  (Fig.  35-16).  As  a  result  of  the 
extensive  derangement  in  electro-
physiology  caused  by  the  previous 
damage  (e.g.,  infarct,  myopathy), 
many areas of the ventricle may have 
diastolic  activation  but  may  not  be 
relevant to perpetuation of the VT. 
These bystander sites make activa-
tion mapping more difficult. Pacing 
techniques such as entrainment can 
be  used  to  test  whether  a  site  is 
actually  part  of  a  circuit  or  is  a 
bystander.  Entrainment 
involves 
pacing for several seconds during a 
tachycardia  at  a  rate  slightly  faster 
than  the  VT  rate;  after  pacing  is 
stopped  and  the  same  tachycardia 
resumes,  the  timing  of  the  first 
complex  relative  to  the  last  paced 
beat is an indicator of how close the 
pacing  site  is  to  a  part  of  the  VT 
circuit. During entrainment, part of 
the ventricle is activated by the paced 
wave front and part by the VT wave 
front being forced to exit earlier than 
it ordinarily would, thereby resulting 
in  a  fusion  complex  on  the  ECG. 
Pacing from within a critical portion 
of the circuit itself produces an exact 
QRS  match  with  the  VT;  fusion 
occurs only within the circuit and is concealed from being discerned 
on the surface ECG. Sites with a low-amplitude, isolated, mid-diastolic 
potential that cannot be dissociated from the tachycardia by pacing 
perturbations,  at  which  entrainment  with  concealed  fusion  can  be 
demonstrated, are highly likely to be successful ablation sites.

S-QRS = 90 msec

In  a  significant  proportion  of  patients  with  VT  and  structural   

heart  disease,  activation  mapping  and  entrainment  cannot  be  per-
formed because of poor hemodynamic tolerance of the arrhythmia or 
inability to initiate sustained tachycardia during an EPS. In these situ-
ations,  additional  methods  can  be  used  that  are  categorized  as   
substrate  mapping,  in  which  areas  of  low  electrical  voltage  or  from 
which  very  delayed  potentials  are  recorded  during  sinus  rhythm  or   
at which pacing closely replicates a known VT 12-lead ECG morphol-
ogy  (pace  mapping)  are  targeted  for  ablation  without  needing  any 
mapping  during  VT  (Fig.  35-17).  These  methods  have  yielded  very 
good results in many cases. In other cases, hemodynamic support in 
the form of catecholamine infusion, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsa-
tion, or a percutaneous temporary ventricular assist device or extra-
corporeal membrane oxygenation has been used to facilitate mapping 
during VT.26

In  patients  without  structural  heart  disease,  only  a  single  VT  is 
usually present, and catheter ablation of that VT is most often cura-
tive.  In  patients  with  extensive  structural  heart  disease,  especially 
those  with  previous  myocardial  infarction,  multiple  VTs  are  usually 
present. Catheter ablation of a single VT in such patients may be only 
palliative  and  not  eliminate  the  need  for  further  antiarrhythmic 
therapy. The genesis of multiple tachycardia morphologies is not clear, 
although  in  some  cases  they  are  merely  different  manifestations  of 
one circuit (e.g., different directions of wave front propagation or exit 
to the ventricle as a whole), and ablation of one may prevent recur-
rence of others. The presence of multiple VT morphologies contributes

those arising in the right ventricular outflow tract. Abnormal patterns 
of sympathetic innervation can be present in some. VTs in abnormal 
hearts  without  coronary  artery  disease  can  be  the  result  of  either 
intramyocardial  or  bundle  branch  reentry  (see  Chapter  37),  most 
typically  observed  in  patients  with  dilated  cardiomyopathy  or  as  a 
focal  process.  Epicardial  foci  and  circuits  are  more  common  in  this 
than in other groups. In patients with bundle branch reentry, ablation 
of the right bundle branch eliminates the tachycardia. VT can occur 
in patients with right ventricular dysplasia (see Chapter 32), sarcoid-
osis, Chagas disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see Chapter 66), 
and a host of other noncoronary disease states.

Activation mapping and pace mapping are effective in patients with 
idiopathic  VTs  to  locate  the  site  of  origin  of  the  VT.  In  activation 
mapping,  the  timing  of  endocardial  electrograms  sampled  by  the 
mapping  catheter  is  compared  with  the  onset  of  the  surface  QRS 
complex. Sites that are activated 20 to 40 milliseconds before onset 
of the surface QRS are near the origin of the VT (Fig. 35-14; also see 
Fig. 34-12). In idiopathic VT, ablation at a site at which the unipolar 
electrogram shows a QS complex may yield greater success than if an 
rS potential is observed (Fig. 35-15). Pace mapping involves stimulation 
of various ventricular sites to produce a QRS contour that duplicates 
the QRS contour of the spontaneous VT, thus establishing the apparent 
site of origin of the arrhythmia (see Fig. 35-14). This technique is limited 
by several methodologic problems but may be useful when the tachy-
cardia cannot be initiated and when a 12-lead ECG has been obtained 
during the spontaneous VT. Presystolic Purkinje potentials, as well as 
very low-amplitude mid-diastolic signals, can be recorded during VT 
from sites at which ablation cures VT in most patients with left ven-
tricular VTs that have a right bundle branch block superior axis. Local-
ization of optimal ablation sites for VT in patients with coronary artery 
disease  and  previous  infarction  can  be  more  challenging  than  in

rences).  Almost  all  these  patients

to  the  difficulties  in  mapping  and  ablation  of  VT  in  these  patients 
because  pacing  techniques  used  to  validate  recordings  at  potential 
sites of ablation may result in a change in morphology to another VT 
that does not arise in the same region.

After  ablation  of  VT,  ventricular  stimulation  is  repeated  to  assess 
efficacy. In some cases, rapid polymorphic VT or VF is initiated. The 
clinical significance of these arrhythmias is unclear, but some evidence 
has suggested that they have a low likelihood of spontaneous occur-
rence during follow-up.

As  noted  earlier,  most  cases  of  polymorphic  VT  and  VF  are  not 
currently  amenable  to  ablation  because  of  hemodynamic  instability 
and  beat-to-beat  changes  in  activation  sequence.  However,  some 
cases  appear  to  have  a  focal  source  (similar  to  the  focal  sources  of 
atrial  fibrillation),  and  if  the  focus  can  be  identified  and  ablated, 
further arrhythmia episodes can be prevented. In such cases, repeated 
episodes of arrhythmia have constant electrocardiographic features of 
the initiating beat or beats, thus suggesting a consistent source, which 
may be in either ventricle. The electrogram at sites of successful abla-
tion often has very sharp presystolic potentials reminiscent of Purkinje 
potentials, with a 50- to 100-millisecond delay until onset of the QRS 
(Fig. 35-18).27

Indications
Patients considered for RF catheter ablation of VT in the absence of 
structural heart disease are those with symptomatic, sustained mono-
morphic VT when the tachycardia is drug resistant, when the patient 

New Mapping and Ablation Technologies 
Multielectrode Mapping Systems.  As noted earlier, many limita-
tions of ablation are related to inadequate mapping. These problems 
include having only isolated premature complexes during the EPS as 
opposed to sustained tachycardias (in idiopathic AT and VT), nonsus-
tained episodes of VT, poor hemodynamic tolerance of VT, and mul-
tiple  VT  morphologies.  Standard  mapping  techniques  sample  single 
sites  sequentially  and  are  poorly  suited  to  these  situations.  New 
mapping  systems  are  available  that  enable  sampling  of  many  sites 
simultaneously and incorporate sophisticated computer algorithms for 
analysis  and  display  of  global  maps.  These  mapping  systems  use 
various  technologies  ranging  from  multiple  electrodes  situated  on 
each of several splines of a basket catheter (see Fig. 34-16), to the use 
of low-intensity electrical or magnetic fields to localize the tip of the 
catheter in the heart and record and plot activation times on a contour 
map of the chamber, to the use of complex mathematics to compute 
virtual electrograms recorded from a mesh electrode situated in the 
middle  of  a  chamber  cavity  or  on  the  body  surface.  Some  of  these 
systems  are  capable  of  generating  activation  maps  of  an  entire 
chamber by using only one cardiac complex, an obvious advantage in 
patients with only rare premature complexes, nonsustained arrhyth-
mias, or poor hemodynamic tolerance of sustained arrhythmias.

Epicardial Catheter Mapping.  Although most VTs can be ablated 
from the endocardium, occasional cases are resistant to this therapy. 
In  many  of  these  cases,  epicardial  ablation  may  be  successful.  It  is 
often needed in VT attributable to cardiomyopathy but less frequently 
in postinfarction patients and those without structural heart disease.

For gaining access to the pericardial space for epicardial mapping 
and  ablation,  a  long  spinal  anesthesia  needle  is  introduced  from  a 
subxiphoid approach under fluoroscopic guidance. As the pericardium 
is  approached,  a  small  amount  of  radiocontrast  agent  is  injected.  If 
the  tip  of  the  needle  is  still  outside  the  pericardium,  the  dye  stays 
where it is injected; when the pericardial space has been entered, the 
dye  disperses  and  outlines  the  heart.  A  guidewire  is  introduced 
through  the  needle  and  a  standard  vascular  introducer  sheath  is 
exchanged over the wire. The pericardial space is then accessible for 
a mapping/ablation catheter. The usual mapping techniques can then 
be  applied.  When  a  site  is  selected  for  possible  ablation,  coronary 
arteriography is usually warranted to avoid delivery of RF energy near 
a coronary artery. This is less important in cases of postinfarction VT 
because the VT substrate is typically in a region of previous transmural 
infarction. The technique can be used for patients who have previously 
undergone  cardiac  surgery,  although  adhesions  may  obliterate  por-
tions of the pericardial space; on occasion, a small subxiphoid incision 
is needed for better access and visualization of the space. The most 
frequent complication of epicardial mapping is pericarditis related to 
the ablation; cardiac tamponade is rare.

Chemical Ablation.  Chemical ablation of an area of myocardium 
involved  in  a  tachycardia  with  alcohol  or  phenol  has  been  used  to 
create AV block in patients not responding to catheter ablation and 
to eliminate AT and VT. Recurrences of tachycardia several days after 
apparently  successful  ablation  are  common.  Excessive  myocardial 
necrosis  is  the  major  complication,  and  alcohol  ablation  should  be 
considered  only  when  other  ablative  approaches  fail  or  cannot  be 
done.

Several  other  mapping/imaging  techniques  have  been  developed 
recently,  including  integration  of  a  previously  obtained  computed 
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging study into computerized 
mapping  systems  and  use  of  intracardiac  ultrasound  to  construct  a 
facsimile of the intracardiac anatomy in any chamber during ablation 
procedures to guide placement of anatomic ablation and reduce fluo-
roscopic  exposure,  use  of  algorithms  to  select  complex  fractionated 
atrial electrograms for ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation, and 
algorithms to assess the fidelity of pace maps with native tachycardia 
complexes.

SURGICALTHERAPYFOR
TACHYARRHYTHMIAS

The objectives of a surgical approach to treatment of a tachycardia 
are to excise, isolate, or interrupt tissue in the heart critical for initia-
tion, maintenance, or propagation of the tachycardia while preserv-
ing  or  even  improving  myocardial  function.  In  addition  to  a  direct 
surgical  approach  to  the  arrhythmia,  indirect  approaches  such  as 

aneurysmectomy, coronary artery bypass grafting, and relief of val-
vular regurgitation or stenosis can be useful in selected patients by 
improving  cardiac  hemodynamics  and  myocardial  blood  supply. 
Cardiac  sympathectomy  alters  adrenergic  influences  on  the  heart 
and has been effective in some patients, particularly those who have 
recurrent VT with long-QT syndrome despite beta blockade and cat-
echolaminergic polymorphic VT.

Supraventricular Tachycardias
Surgical  procedures  exist  for  patients  (adults  and  children)  with  AT, 
atrial flutter and fibrillation (see Chapter 38), AV node reentry, and 
AV reentry (Fig. 35-19). RF catheter ablation adequately treats most 
of  these  patients  and  thus  has  replaced  direct  surgical  intervention, 
except for the occasional patient in whom RF catheter ablation fails 
or  who  is  undergoing  concomitant  cardiovascular  surgery.  In  some 
cases, a prior attempt at RF catheter ablation complicates surgery by 
obliterating  the  normal  tissue  planes  that  exist  in  the  AV  groove  of 
the heart or by rendering tissues friable. On occasion, patients with 
ATs have multiple foci that require surgical intervention. Several surgi-
cal procedures have been developed to treat atrial fibrillation; these 
are reviewed in Chapter 38.

VentricularTachycardia
In contrast to patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, candidates 
for surgical therapy for ventricular arrhythmias often have severe left 
ventricular  dysfunction,  generally  the  result  of  coronary  artery 
disease.  The  cause  of  the  underlying  heart  disease  influences  the 
type  of  surgery  performed.  Candidates  are  patients  with  drug-
resistant, symptomatic, recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias who 
ideally have a segmental wall motion abnormality (scar or aneurysm) 
with preserved residual left ventricular function, have not benefited 
from previous attempts at catheter ablation, or are not candidates for 
catheter ablation because of hemodynamic instability during VT or 
the  presence  of  left  ventricular  thrombi  (precluding  endocardial 
catheter  ablation).  Poorer  surgical  results  are  obtained  in  patients 
with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Ischemic Heart Disease
In  almost  all  patients  who  have  VT  associated  with  ischemic  heart 
disease, the arrhythmia, regardless of its configuration on the surface 
ECG, arises in the left ventricle or on the left ventricular side of the 
interventricular septum. The electrocardiographic contour of the VT 
can change from a right bundle branch block to a left bundle branch 
block pattern without a change in the site of earliest diastolic activa-
tion,  thus  suggesting  that  the  location  of  the  circuit  within  the  left

FIGURE35-20  Schematic diagram showing surgical procedures for the treatment of postinfarction VT with a left ventricular aneurysm. A damaged left ventricle is depicted 
as opened along the lateral wall and showing the septum and papillary muscles. The tachycardia circuit (upper left) takes a meandering course near the point where the an-
eurysm meets normal myocardium and at times is superficial (purple lines) and at other times is coursing deeper (green lines). Simple aneurysmectomy that leaves a portion of 
the aneurysm for suturing often misses the circuit and thus does not cure the arrhythmia. By subendocardial resection, a layer of endocardium and subjacent tissue is removed, 
including at least some of the tachycardia circuit. Such resection results in elimination of the tachycardia. Encircling endocardial ventriculotomy attempts to isolate the circuit 
electrically without removal of tissue, but it probably actually works by incising portions of the circuit. Cryoablation can be used to encircle the infarct zone or in combination 
with resection of damaged tissue too deep in the wall to be resected safely. 

ventricle  remains  the  same,  often  near  the  septum,  but  its  exit 
pathway is altered.

Indirect surgical approaches, including cardiothoracic sympathec-
tomy, coronary artery revascularization, and ventricular aneurysm or 
infarct  resection  with  or  without  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting, 
have been successful in no more than 20% to 30% of reported cases. 
Coronary artery bypass grafting as a primary therapeutic approach 
has generally been successful only in patients who experience rapid 
VT because of severe ischemia, as well as in patients with ischemia-
related VF, but it can sometimes be useful in patients with coronary 
disease  resuscitated  from  sudden  death  who  have  no  inducible 
arrhythmias at EPS. These patients generally have a clear relationship 
between  episodes  of  ventricular  arrhythmia  and  immediately  ante-
cedent severe ischemia and have no evidence of infarction or minimal 
wall motion abnormalities but have preserved overall left ventricular 
function. Patients with sustained monomorphic VT or only polymor-
phic  VT  rarely  have  their  arrhythmias  affected  by  coronary  bypass 
surgery, although it can reduce the frequency of the arrhythmic epi-
sodes in some patients and prevent new ischemic events.

Surgical Techniques.  In general, two types of direct surgical pro-
cedures  are  used,  resection  and  ablation  (Fig.  35-20).  The  first 
direct  surgical  approach  to  VT  was  encircling  endocardial  ventricu-
lotomy,  which  entails  performing  a  transmural  ventriculotomy  to 
isolate areas of endocardial fibrosis that were recognized visually; this 
procedure  is  rarely  used  now.  Another  procedure,  subendocardial 
resection, is based on data indicating that arrhythmias after myocar-
dial  infarction  arise  mostly  at  the  subendocardial  borders  between 
normal and infarcted tissue. Subendocardial resection involves peeling 
off a 1- to 3-mm-thick layer of endocardium, often near the rim of 
an aneurysm, that has been demonstrated by mapping procedures to 
contain sites of mid-diastolic activation recorded during VT. Tachycar-
dias  arising  from  near  the  base  of  the  papillary  muscles  are  treated 
with a cryoprobe cooled to 70°C. Cryoablation can also be used to 

isolate  areas  of  the  ventricle  that  cannot  be  resected  and  is  often 
combined  with  resection.  Lasers  have  also  been  used  with  good 
success, but the equipment is expensive and cumbersome.

Results.  For  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias,  operative  mortality 
ranges  from  5%  to  10%;  success,  defined  as  the  absence  of  recur-
rence of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias, is achieved in 59% to 
98% of patients. In experienced centers, operative mortality can be 
as low as 5% in stable patients undergoing elective procedures, with 
85%  to  95%  of  survivors  being  free  of  inducible  or  spontaneous 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Long-term recurrence rates range from 
2% to 15% and correlate with results of the patients postoperative 
electrophysiologic  stimulation  study.  Operative  survival  is  strongly 
influenced by the degree of left ventricular dysfunction.

Operative mortality for nonthoracotomy ICD implantation is far less 
than 1%, with an annual sudden cardiac death mortality rate of less 
than 2%. Because of the difference in operative survival and shorter 
hospital stay with ICD insertion than with direct surgery for VT and 
the  success  rates  for  catheter  ablation  in  patients  who  have  an  ICD 
but experience frequent episodes of VT, few curative surgical proce-
dures are now performed.

Electrophysiologic Studies
Preoperative  Electrophysiologic  Study.  In  patients  for  whom 
direct surgical therapy for VT is planned, a preoperative EPS is usually 
warranted.  This  study  involves  initiation  of  the  VT  and  electrophysi-
ologic  mapping  to  localize  the  area  to  be  resected,  as  is  done  with 
catheter ablation. Preoperative catheter mapping is contraindicated in 
patients with known left ventricular thrombi that might be dislodged 
by the mapping catheter.

Intraoperative Ventricular Mapping.  Electrophysiologic mapping 
is  also  performed  at  the  time  of  surgery,  with  the  surgeon  using  a 
handheld  probe  or  an  electrode  array  coupled  with  computer  tech-
niques that instantaneously provide an overall activation map, cycle by 
cycle. The sequence of activation during VT can be plotted and the area 
of  earliest  activation  determined.  Resection  or  cryoablation  of  tissue 
from which these recordings are made usually cures the VT, thus indi-
cating  that  they  represent  a  critical  portion  of  the  reentrant  circuit.

than 30 milliseconds before onset of the QRS complex, the critical por-
tions of the circuit may be in the interventricular septum or near the 
epicardium of the free wall. In some patients, intramural mapping using 
a  plunge  needle  electrode  can  be  useful.  Most  centers  have  used  a 
strategy of sequential subendocardial resection in which VT is initi-
ated, mapped, and ablated (resected or cryoablated) while the heart is 
warm and beating, and stimulation is repeated immediately. If VT can 
still be initiated, mapping and resection are also repeated until VT can 
no longer be initiated. Reentry around an inferior scar, with a critical 
diastolic pathway confined to an isthmus of ventricular muscle between 
the scar and mitral valve annulus, can be cured by cryoablation of this 
isthmus. Cure rates in this situation exceed 93%.
